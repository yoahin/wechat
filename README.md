# Posts
Posts for my WeChat channel, which focuses on reading long, (usually) well-written articles that interest me.

All posts are marked up with HTML plus a few CSS styles, mimicing those from which they are extracted.

Templating is done by [jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/).

Contents are scraped from online using Python and lxml/xpath.

# Demo
WeChat Official Account Platform is a relatively closed social medium.
It does not provide such a basic feature as "Permanent URL" of a specific post hosted on it.
Thus, it's is impossible to link any "blog" page here. To get a feel of what a post looks like, follow the below steps:
1. Visit this Sogou search page: https://weixin.sogou.com/
2. Enter "Inside North Koreaâ€™s Hacker Army" (a blog title)
3. Click on the first result

That's it.
