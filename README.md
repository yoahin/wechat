# Posts
Posts for my WeChat channel, focus on reading long, (usually) well-written articles that interest me.

All posts are marked up with HTML plus a few CSS styles, mimicing those from which they are extracted.


Templating is done by jinja2.

Contents are scraped from online using Python and html.parser, but the whole scraping project is being refactored with lxml/html.parser.
