    <span class="cap">I</span>n the fall of 1996, the Peace Corps sent me to teach English to college students in Fuling, a remote city on the Yangtze River. I was twenty-seven years old, and I was joined by another volunteer, Adam Meier, who was twenty-two. Not long after we arrived, a student named Richard submitted an essay to my writing class titled “Why Americans Are So Casual.” Richard was skinny, shy, and <ruby>
        bespectacled<rt>wearing spectacles</rt>
    </ruby>. He had grown up in Fuling, and most of his classmates came from the Sichuanese countryside. At the time, China’s population was more than seventy per cent rural, and only eight per cent of students went to college. Adam and I were the first Americans to live in Fuling since <ruby>the 
        Revolution<rt>Great Cultural Revolution</rt>
    </ruby>. In his essay, Richard wrote, in English:
</p>
<p class="quotes">
    Our foreign language teachers—Peter and Adam—came to teach us this term. It provides a good opportunity of understanding the American way of life. In my opinion, they are more casual than Chinese people. Why do I think so? I’ll give you some facts to explain this.<sup>㋡</sup>

    We were part of a Peace Corps <ruby>

    </ruby> known as China 3. The agency’s groups have always been numbered, perhaps because it implies a sense of mission. The Peace Corps was founded by President John F. Kennedy, in 1961—the year of Saturn 1<sup>❉</sup><sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup> and Sputnik 9<sup>❉</sup><sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❷</sup>. In the same way that the Apollo rockets went up in sequence, each Peace Corps cohort was intended to travel to a distant land<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❸</sup>, build on the work of its predecessors, then return home. And, just like the rockets, the Peace Corps was a Cold War endeavor. It was inspired by “The Ugly American,”<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❹</sup> a 1958 novel that warned readers that the Soviets were doing a better job of grassroots work in the developing world. The Peace Corps had three goals: to provide useful assistance to “interested countries,” to improve understanding of the United States, and to help Americans understand the rest of the world.

The rocket's first stage was built as a cluster of propellant tanks engineered from older rocket tank designs, leading critics to jokingly refer to it as "<b>Cluster's Last Stand</b>". <u>Originally intended as a near-universal military booster for use in the 1960s, its development was taken over from the Advanced Research Projects Agency in 1958 by the newly-formed civilian NASA</u>.

        The book caused a sensation in diplomatic circles and had major political implications. <u>The Peace Corps was established during the Kennedy administration partly as a result of the book</u>. The bestseller has remained continuously in print and is one of the most influential American political novels. It has been called an "iconic Cold War text."

    By the time I joined, relatively few volunteers were aware of these Cold War roots. Time had moved on, or maybe it had stopped—this was the era of “The End of History and the Last Man,”<sup>❉</sup> the 1992 book by Francis Fukuyama<sup>❉</sup>, who declared the triumph of Western liberal democracy. In 1996, the Peace Corps was sending volunteers to Russia, Poland, Bulgaria, and other former Soviet-bloc states that had supposedly transitioned to democracy. China was the only Communist country that accepted volunteers.

    Deng Xiaoping had welcomed the Peace Corps as part of his Reform and Opening strategy, but some Chinese officials weren’t convinced that Americans should be working in remote places like Fuling. They referred to the program by a euphemism—Meizhong Youhao Zhiyuanzhe, or “U.S.-China Friendship Volunteers”—because the Chinese translation of “Peace Corps” had been tainted by years of Maoist propaganda. The first three cohorts were small, which made it easier for the government to track us. The curiosity of locals was even more intense. Richard’s essay continued:
</p>

<p class="quotes">
    For example, when Mr. Hessler is having class, he can scratch himself casually without paying attention to what others may say.<sup>㋡</sup> He dresses up casually, usually with his belt dropping and dangling. But, to tell you the truth, it isn’t considered a good manner in China, especially in old people’s eyes.

    China 3 consisted of fourteen volunteers, and, before joining, none of us had taken a single class in Chinese language, history, politics, or culture. In those days, Peace Corps applicants didn’t choose their destinations. All the China 3 volunteers were white, and had almost no experience in the developing world; one, from Mississippi, had never been on an airplane before. The majority came from the Midwest or the South—Adam was from Wisconsin, and I was a Missourian. For many of us, the Peace Corps represented an inexpensive way to go abroad.<sup>㋡</sup>

    Our students were majoring in English, another project of Reform and Opening. China was expanding compulsory English education, which created new demand for instructors; after graduation, our students would be assigned to teach in middle and high schools.<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup> But their concept of the outside world remained abstract. They had no Internet access, and the Communist Party published all their texts, including a cultural-studies book called “Survey of Britain and America.” A chapter about American history began, naturally enough, with China: “The Indians living in America originated from Asia some 25,000 years ago.” After listing some key details about the European discovery of the New World—“it also opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie”—the text proceeded to the founding of the United States. (“The Constitution of 1787 established the dictatorship of the American bourgeoisie.”) A section about contemporary society claimed that nowadays most New Englanders work in factories. (“They are good at making watches and clocks.”) There was some useful information about American slang. (“For example, ‘draw one’ or ‘shoot one’ means ‘pour a cup of coffee.’ ”) Chapter 4 covered “Social Problems”:
</p>
<p class="quotes">
    Homosexuality is a rather strange social phenomenon that most people can hardly understand. It widely spreads. One reason for this may be the despair in marriage or love affairs.

<p>
    The chapter concluded by explaining the primary cause of homosexuality and other social problems:
</p>
<p class="quotes">
    The most important reason is the capitalist system of America.<sup>㋡</sup> In this capitalist society, although science and technology is highly advanced, some people are suffering from spiritual hollowness. Thus they start to look for things curious and exciting.

        這種狹隘的認知在今天終于凸顯了它的困境：社會主義的中國也有了同性戀群體，那麽是否要歸罪於鄧的市場經濟路綫？顯然是荒謬的。

    <p>
        後面幾句話提到的困境完全能引發今日年輕人的共鳴。經濟飛速發展的地區，這些陣痛和社會問題是必然要面對的，和什麽主義沒有必然聯係。

    <p>
        可悲的是，如今的同性戀群體，依然遭受了社會文化的排斥和政策層面的打壓。中央电视台《新闻调查》欄目有一期是以從防控艾滋病作爲切入點的，柴靜采訪了當時的青島大學醫學院附屬醫院性健康中心教授張北川。張教授就明確提出，同性戀不是病，不用矯正。希望看到大家不覺得他們奇怪的那一天。參見：https://www.bilibili.com/video/av298895/

    In part to keep the students as far as possible from “Survey of Britain and America,” Adam and I used whatever we could find as teaching materials.<sup>㋡</sup> We brought photographs of family to class, and we made copies of articles from American magazines. When we received our absentee ballots<sup>㋡</sup> for the 1996 Presidential election, Adam and I each gave a lecture on the U.S. political system to a section of senior students. At the end, we took out the ballots, allowed the students to inspect them, and voted.

    The students became very quiet when I handed them my ballot. We were in a small, unheated room, packed with more than forty simple wooden desks.
