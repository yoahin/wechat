        <span class="cap">R</span>ick Scott began demanding an end to Peace Corps China in the summer of 2019. “What the Peace Corps shouldn’t be doing is propping up our adversaries with U.S. tax dollars,” the Senator said, in a statement. Such criticism had also been made in 2011, by Mike Coffman, a Republican congressman from Colorado. Scott introduced a bill that would cancel programs “in hostile countries, like China,” and place the Peace Corps under the oversight of the State Department.<sup>㋡</sup>

        Once Scott entered the Senate, though, he became a vocal opponent of<sup>㋡</sup> China. In response to the Senator’s pressure, Claborne, the head of the China program, received an unusual request from Peace Corps headquarters. Scott wanted to analyze Peace Corps China in business terms, examining the return on investment. “He was looking for things like how many volunteers came back and started businesses and created wealth because of their work in China,” Claborne told me.

        Claborne worried that somebody <ruby>

        </ruby> little understanding of the Peace Corps was being allowed to redefine how it should be valued. He also believed that Scott’s point that China is now a developed nation was irrelevant. Nothing in the Peace Corps mission statement specifies that partner countries must be poor, and the agency often looks closely at the Human Development Index, which considers a range of factors, including access to education. But the Peace Corps asked Claborne to assemble materials about return on investment<sup>㋡</sup>, which he assumed were passed on to Scott. The Senator declared himself unsatisfied, and the Peace Corps never responded publicly.

        The director, Olsen, had a long history with the agency, including time as a volunteer in Tunisia, in the nineteen-sixties. Some members of the Peace Corps community had feared that the Trump Administration would bring in an outsider to dismantle the agency, so Olsen’s appointment was greeted with relief. But, when the China program was attacked, Olsen stayed silent.<sup>㋡</sup>

        The pressure on the Peace Corps was connected to a growing <ruby>
            anti-China sentiment<rt>排华或反华的情绪</rt>
        </ruby>. In some ways, it’s <ruby>
            reminiscent of<rt>reminding people of</rt>
        </ruby> the era of “Farewell, Leighton Stuart!”—a frustration that China has not followed a path that Americans would prefer. Many China specialists are concerned that the U.S. is overreacting. James Millward, a Georgetown University historian who is a vocal critic of China’s treatment of Uighurs, told me that he opposed cutting off the Peace Corps and other forms of engagement. He believes that the Magnitsky Act<sup>❉</sup>, which allows the U.S. to sanction human-rights violators, should be applied to Chinese organizations and individuals who are active in the concentration camps. “It’s a measure that should be more directly associated with what is going on in Xinjiang, rather than keeping people from teaching English in Chengdu,” he said.

            The <b>Magnitsky Act</b>, formally known as the Russia and Moldova Jackson–Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012, is a bipartisan bill passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in December 2012, <u>intending to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky</u> in a Moscow prison in 2009 and also to grant permanent normal trade relations status to Russia. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2016 the bill, which applies globally, authorizes the US government to <u>sanction those who it sees as human rights offenders, freeze their assets, and ban them from entering the U.S</u>.

        But the issue was settled quickly, behind closed doors.<sup>㋡</sup> In November, the National Security Council held a meeting about Peace Corps China, chaired by Matthew Pottinger, the deputy national-security adviser. Pottinger is a former journalist in Beijing who subsequently joined the Marines, and he is known for his hawkish views on China. A senior official who served on the N.S.C. during the Obama Administration told me that <u> <span class="u-mark">☈</span>it’s unheard of for</u> a deputy-level meeting to be held about a specific volunteer program. Peace Corps China cost $4.2 million in 2018, less than the State Department spent on the International Pacific <ruby>
            Halibut<rt>大比目魚</rt>
        </ruby> Commission<sup>❉</sup>. “If you are deputy national-security adviser, you should have much more important issues on your plate,” the official said. “Think about what’s happening in November. Shouldn’t he be meeting on Iran?”

        The following month, Olsen submitted a letter to the Office of Management and Budget announcing that Peace Corps China would be closed. Olsen’s letter noted that budgetary funds would be freed up for use in other places, mentioning three possible sites that don’t currently have volunteers: the Solomon Islands, Vietnam, and Greenland. There has been speculation that these countries were named in order to appeal to various geopolitical interests within the Administration. The Solomon Islands<sup>㋡</sup> would satisfy those hoping to counter China’s influence in the Pacific, and a new program in Vietnam<sup>㋡</sup> would fulfill the old idea of battling Communism. And Greenland because—well, because Greenland.<sup>㋡</sup>
