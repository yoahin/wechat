    <span class="cap">O</span>n the morning of January 17th, shortly before I was scheduled to meet with a hundred and forty Peace Corps volunteers in Chengdu<sup>㋡</sup>, the capital of Sichuan Province, there was an unexpected announcement that the China program was ending. The Peace Corps had first come to the country in 1993, and as a volunteer from the early years I had been asked to speak at an <ruby>
        in-service training<rt>在職培訓</rt>
    </ruby> that the organization was holding in a hotel near where I live. But by the time I arrived nobody was <ruby>
        in the mood for<rt>feel like to have some</rt>
    </ruby> nostalgia. <sup class="pattern">SP1</sup><u>The American volunteers, most of whom were in their twenties, looked stunned; some were red-eyed <ruby>
        from<rt>because of</rt>
    </ruby> crying.</u> At the back of the room, more than a dozen Chinese staff members stood with stoic expressions. <ruby>
        They<rt>Chinese staff</rt>
    </ruby> had given up some benefits of the Chinese system in order to work for the American agency. From the ceiling, somebody had hung a red propaganda-style banner, which proved that Americans could make their slogans <ruby>
        every bit<rt>just</rt>
    </ruby> as <ruby>
        tone-deaf<rt>分辨不出語氣强烈程度</rt>
    </ruby><sup>㋡</sup> as the ones in the People’s Republic. The banner said “Welcome to IST 2020: Be the Tree You Wish to See in the World.”

        Peace Corps，和平使者，是一個在全球活動的公益組織。旨在促進和平，推動教育發展。2020年年初，該組織宣佈停止其在中國的項目，受到關注。何偉本篇就是在說此事。

The Peace Corps has sent more than thirteen hundred volunteers to China, and the agency, which is now active in sixty countries, has always been viewed as removed from political spats.<sup>㋡</sup> The U.S. had never ended a Peace Corps program because of a diplomatic conflict, but the timing of the decision about China seemed suspicious. The coronavirus had yet to come to widespread attention, and the Senators, who had previously expressed doubts about a Chinese trade deal, tweeted the day after President Trump signed a Phase 1 economic agreement with China.

That month, the U.S. State Department had issued a white paper that, in more than a thousand tortured<sup>㋡</sup> pages, tried to explain how America had “lost” China to Mao’s revolutionaries: “This is a frank record of an extremely complicated and most unhappy period in the life of a great country to which the United States has long been attached by ties of closest friendship.”

He was a towering figure in U.S.-Chinese relations in the first half of the 20th century, a man TIME magazine called "perhaps the most respected American in China."

    In his essay, Mao derided American democracy as “another name for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie,”<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup> and he celebrated the departure of John Leighton Stuart, the last U.S. Ambassador to China under the Kuomintang government. For years, the isolationist essay was part of the school curriculum, and many Chinese people recognize the ending: “Leighton Stuart has departed and the White Paper has arrived, very good, very good.
