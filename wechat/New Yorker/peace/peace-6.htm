        </ruby> staffers <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>had applied hoping for</u> better relations between China and the United States. They had largely given up the opportunity for social-security benefits in order to work for the American agency, whose status meant that some staff had difficulty applying for mortgages and credit cards.

        The agency had informed staff and volunteers that China would be “graduating”—it was now so developed that it no longer needed Peace Corps teachers. But, the woman asked me, “if that was the case, why were <ruby>
            they<rt>PCs in China</rt>
        </ruby> trying to expand<sup>㋡</sup> so recently?” She added, “It’s like a divorce by one side,” noting that the news came less than a week before the lunar New Year holiday. Back in the U.S., the Peace Corps had already invited scores of new volunteers to serve in the next China cohort; now those applicants had to be reassigned. Helen Lowman, a former Peace Corps regional director who organized the graduation of programs in Romania and Bulgaria in the past decade, told me that she had never heard of such an abrupt and chaotic decision to <ruby>
            phase out<rt>gradually leave</rt>
        </ruby> a country. “I probably talked to the host-country government for three years before we actually closed,”<sup>㋡</sup>
        she said.

        An African-American woman named Khloe Benton told me that she had been posted to a site in Gansu that had few foreign residents. “It’s been hard,” she said. “People follow me around, and they <ruby>

        </ruby>.”<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup> But she believed that it was important for locals to meet a person of color. The Peace Corps had told volunteers that they would <ruby>finish

        Eleven days later, the coronavirus caused the evacuation of all China volunteers. The same thing had happened with sars, in 2003, but the Peace Corps had returned the following year<sup>2004</sup>. This time, the program <ruby>
            was finished<rt>will never come back</rt>
        </ruby>—the last micro-history belonged to China 25. The volunteers had spent a little more than six months in the country.

    <p>
        One official in the State Department told me there were rumors that the White House had threatened the Peace Corps with budget cuts if it didn’t end the China program. When I asked Rick Scott, he said that he didn’t know how the Administration<sup>㋡</sup> had made the decision, although he described his meetings with Jody Olsen and other Peace Corps officials. “I said, ‘What I’ve been told is that the volunteers who are there, they don’t coördinate anything with the State Department, they don’t promote American values, they don’t promote capitalism,’ ” Scott said. I asked if he had received the materials about return on investment, and whether they included such information as the number of volunteers who became diplomats.<sup>㋡</sup>

        I said that twenty-seven former China volunteers now work in the State Department, and asked if this knowledge might have changed his mind. “I’d have to get more information,” he said, adding that the Peace Corps hadn’t been forthcoming. I had no way of checking this, because the Peace Corps and Olsen ignored multiple requests for an interview.

        It occurred to me that this would have been a good follow-up lesson to our Fuling lectures about American democracy. In the <ruby>
            nineties<rt>1990s</rt>
        </ruby>, we had known that the Chinese could cancel the program at any time. It had seemed a small miracle that local colleges were somehow able to communicate to high-level conservatives that Peace Corps teachers were worth the risk.<sup>㋡</sup>

        Twenty years later, though, the Americans had discussed nothing openly,<sup>㋡</sup> and Peace Corps administrators must have been either so frightened or so incompetent that they hadn’t defended themselves. The ideas that inspired “The Ugly American”—the importance of grassroots and local knowledge—had been abandoned. During our conversation, Scott acknowledged that he and his staff had not spoken with any current or former China volunteers.

        The old confidence had also vanished. It seemed part of a larger American trend: every foreign contact was a threat, every exchange was zero-sum. Instead of trusting themselves and their best models, people regressed to the paranoia of those with closed systems. In the Washington Examiner, a conservative magazine, Tom Rogan celebrated the end of Peace Corps China. When Rogan mentioned the Chinese Ministry of State Security<sup>㋡</sup>, he probably had no idea how much he sounded like a ministry <ruby>

        We must thus ask how many of the more than 1,300 previous volunteers in China may have been recruited by the MSS during their time there. The number is likely very small, but unlikely to be zero. How many of those volunteers then returned home to take up employment in the State Department or another U.S. government agency?
