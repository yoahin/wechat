      In the early two-thousands, Merlin Mann, a Web designer and <ruby>avowed<rt>publicly known</rt></ruby> Macintosh enthusiast, was working as a freelance project manager for software companies. He had held similar roles for years, so he knew the ins and outs of the job; he was surprised, therefore, to find that he was overwhelmed—not by the <ruby>intellectual aspects<rt>脑力劳动</rt></ruby> of his work but by the many small administrative tasks, such as scheduling conference calls, that <ruby>bubbled up<rt>increased gradually</rt></ruby> from a turbulent stream of e-mail messages.<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup> “I was in this batting cage<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup>, deluged with information,” he told me recently. “I went to college. I was smart. Why was I having such a hard time?”

Mann wasn’t alone in his frustration. In the nineteen-nineties, the spread of e-mail had transformed knowledge work. With nearly all friction removed from professional communication, anyone could bother anyone else at any time.<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup> Many e-mails brought obligations: to answer a question, look into a <ruby>lead<rt>a piece of info</rt></ruby>, arrange a meeting, or provide feedback. Work lives that had once been sequential—two or three blocks of work, broken up by meetings and phone calls—became frantic, improvisational, and impossibly overloaded. “E-mail is a ball of uncertainty that represents anxiety,” Mann said, <ruby>reflecting on this period<rt>thinking seriously about this era</rt></ruby>.

      <p><b>Knowledge workers</b> are workers whose main capital is knowledge. Examples include programmers, physicians, pharmacists, architects, engineers, scientists, design thinkers, public accountants, lawyers, and academics, and any other white-collar workers, whose line of work requires one to "think for a living".</p>

      In 2003, he came across a book that seemed to address his frustrations. It was titled “Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity,”<sup style="color: #81A1C1">1</sup> and, for Mann, it changed everything. The time-management system it described, called G.T.D., had been developed by David Allen, a consultant turned entrepreneur who lived in the crunchy mountain town<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup> of Ojai, California. Allen combined ideas from Zen Buddhism with the strict organizational techniques he’d honed while advising corporate clients. He proposed a theory about how our minds work: <strong>when we try to keep track of obligations in our heads, we create “open loops” that make us anxious.</strong> That anxiety, in turn, reduces our ability to think effectively. If we could avoid worrying about what we were supposed to be doing, we could focus more fully on what we were actually doing, achieving what Allen called a “mind like water.”

      <p>crunchy 指食物口感或质地爽脆。这里是说 Ojai 小镇的生活贴近自然，无拘无束。因为 crunchy 在美语中还有一个意思： politically liberal and environmentally aware。下文中也提到了 Allen 从禅宗里受到了启发。</p>

To maintain such a mind, one must deal with new obligations before they can become <ruby>entrenched<rt>fixed for a long time</rt></ruby> as open loops. G.T.D.’s solution is a multi-step system. It begins with what Allen describes as full capture: the idea is to maintain a set of in-boxes into which you can drop obligations as soon as they arise. One such in-box might be a physical tray on your desk; when you suddenly remember that you need to finish a task before an upcoming meeting, you can jot a reminder on a piece of paper, toss it in the tray, and, without breaking concentration, return to whatever it was you were doing. Throughout the day, you might add similar thoughts to other in-boxes, such as a list on your computer or a pocket notebook. <strong>But jotting down notes isn’t, in itself, enough to close the loops; your mind must trust that you will return to your in-boxes and process what’s inside them.</strong> Allen calls this final, crucial step regular review. During reviews, you transform your haphazard reminders into concrete “next actions,” then enter them onto a master list.

GTD workflow
    <p>
This list can now provide a motive force for your efforts. In his book, Allen recommends organizing the master list into contexts, such as @phone or @computer. Moving through the day, you can simply look at the tasks listed under your current context and execute them one after another. Allen uses the analogy of cranking widgets to describe this calmly mechanical approach to work. It’s a rigorous system for the generation of <ruby>serenity<rt>calmness</rt></ruby>.

To someone with Mann’s engineering sensibility, the precision of G.T.D. was appealing, and the method itself seemed ripe for optimization. In September, 2004, Mann started a blog called 43 Folders—a reference to an organizational hack, the “tickler file,” described in Allen’s book. In an introductory post, Mann wrote, “Believe me, if you keep finding that the water of your life has somehow run onto the floor, GTD may be just the drinking glass you need to get things back together.” He published nine posts about G.T.D. during the blog’s first month. The discussion was often highly technical:<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup> in one post, he proposed the creation of a unified XML format for G.T.D. data, which would allow different apps to display the same tasks in multiple formats, including “graphical map, outline, RDF, structured text.” He told me that the writer Cory Doctorow linked to an early 43 Folders post on Doctorow’s popular nerd-culture site, Boing Boing. Traffic surged. Mann soon announced that, in just thirty days, 43 Folders had received over a hundred and fifty thousand unique visitors. (“That’s just <ruby>nuts<rt>fans</rt></ruby>,” he wrote.) The site became so popular that Mann quit his job to work on it full time. As his influence grew, he popularized a new term for the genre that he was helping to create: “productivity pr0n,”<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup> an adaptation of the “leet speak,”<sup>❉</sup> or geek lingo, word for pornography. The hunger for this pr0n, he noticed, was insatiable. People were desperate to tinker with their productivity systems.
