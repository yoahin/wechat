        <span class="cap">O</span>n April 14th, the New York City Health Department revised its count of how many New Yorkers had died of covid-19 in the previous month. Earlier estimates put the number of fatalities around seven thousand, but it now appeared that an additional three thousand people, who were never tested, had died from the virus. “What New Yorkers are interested in, and what the country is interested in, is that we have an accurate and complete count,”<sup>㋡</sup> Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the head of the city’s health department, told the <i>Times</i><sup>[1]</sup>. “It’s part of the healing process that we’re going to have to go through.”<sup>㋡</sup>

        On Hart Island<sup>[2]</sup>, off the coast of the Bronx, authorities have begun <ruby>
            interring<rt>bury (the dead)</rt>
        </ruby> victims whose remains were either unidentified or unclaimed by family members, and city officials are searching for other places to bury the dead. There aren’t enough funeral directors to retrieve all the bodies; at one point, the city put out a call for volunteers among veterinarians and laboratory technicians “because of their familiarity with the deceased and bereaved.” Recently, when Zambito went to the Brooklyn Medical Examiner’s office to retrieve a body, she met a funeral director from Texas. He didn’t have a New York license, but the medical examiners were relieved to have someone trained in the field. “It was clear the city was in need,” he told her. “I drove over.”

        Funeral homes across the city were overwhelmed. “This is a state of emergency,” Pat Marmo, a mortician in Sunset Park, told<sup>[3]</sup> the Associated Press<sup>[4]</sup>. “We need help.” He was telling mourners to plead with hospitals on his behalf: if the morgues could hold onto bodies for a few extra days, there might be more time for mortuaries to make space. Yet finding refrigeration units to store the remains was becoming harder, too; many companies were reluctant to rent to funeral homes in the midst of a pandemic. Funeral directors were left with little choice but to <ruby>
            crank<rt>let sth work harder</rt>
        </ruby> their air-conditioners and continue working. Like Sherman’s, one parlor in Rego Park, Queens, had converted a chapel into a “makeshift refrigerator.”

        Andrew Cottone, Sherman’s other funeral director, has worked in the industry for the past thirty-one years, through the aids epidemic and historic outbreaks of <ruby>
            hepatitis<rt>肝炎</rt>
        </ruby> and swine flu. “Nothing even comes close to what’s going on right now,” he said. At one point, because of the volume of cases, he was unable to retrieve the body of someone who died at 8 p.m. until the following evening. And yet, for the first time in recent memory, funeral directors were no longer the only people across the city doing this work. Fifteen teams of soldiers, from the U.S. Army, the National Guard, and the Air National Guard, have been working in twelve-hour shifts, overseen by the city’s chief medical examiner; according to the <i>Times</i><sup>[5]</sup>, they were picking up more than two hundred bodies a day. Eventually, though, if a family wanted to bury or cremate a loved one, funeral directors needed to get involved. They were, in fact, the final front-line medical workers: the last necessary step between life and death.<sup>㋡</sup>

        Ordinarily, individual funeral directors could make hospital removals on their own, with body bags and a stretcher, but since the <ruby>
            onset<rt>beginning</rt>
        </ruby> of the pandemic retrievals have become a two-person job. <sup class="pattern">SP7</sup><u>A single mistake—a fumble or a slip, a slight tear in a body bag—could be deadly.</u> Trips to hospital morgues were the most harrowing, Cottone told me. “It used to be that you’d go into a local hospital and, if we saw seven bodies in the morgue, they’d be really busy. Now we’re seeing fifty or sixty bodies in each <ruby>
            trailer<rt>拖車</rt>

        As the death toll surged in the early weeks of the crisis, the refrigerated trucks that hospitals were using to manage the overflow quickly grew disorganized, with bodies mixed together in piles on the floor. Cottone could barely stand inside some of them. He had to shuffle in and, as carefully as possible, <ruby>
            rifle<rt>search quickly</rt>
        </ruby> through body bags to find the one he was looking for. “You have to open the pouch to confirm the name of the person you’re picking up on a wrist or toe tag,” he said. “You see the forearms, the hands, the fingers, the ankles. You get a look at the face.” Many of the bodies appeared to have been ravaged by covid-19. “There’s a lot of <ruby>
            mucus<rt>鼻涕</rt>
        </ruby> discharge,” he said. “They’re bloated up. The heads and eyelids are swollen.”<sup>㋡</sup>

        In the past three weeks, hospitals have instituted sorting systems, with bodies kept on improvised structures made of milk crates and wood planks. In most places, Cottone can now walk down an aisle to locate a body, each of which has been assigned a number and a corresponding position. Yet, even under these improved conditions, he told me, those who died of covid-19 pose a particular challenge: their bodies are often much heavier, <ruby>
            from edema<rt>because of 水腫</rt>
        </ruby>, caused by their prolonged time spent on respirators. He had recently picked up a body from the morgue at Mt. Sinai Hospital, on King’s Highway, which weighed about three hundred pounds. It was on the bottom rack of the trailer, level with the floor. If he dragged the bag, he risked puncturing it. He tried lifting it from a low squat and then pulling in short bursts. Finally, with a partner’s help, he succeeded in inching the body to a waiting stretcher.
