    <span class="cap">O</span>n Good Friday<sup>❉</sup>, Chris Kasler went to church via Zoom. An observant <ruby>

    </ruby><sup>㋡</sup>, he couldn’t help but feel that he was witnessing something on a Biblical scale. “This is a plague,” he told me. “God is in control; we’re not in control.” That evening, using his daughter’s iPad, he called in to the service hosted at the Church of the Good Shepherd on Fourth Avenue, in Bay Ridge. The church was once the preferred <ruby>
        congregation<rt>教堂會衆</rt>
    </ruby> of the neighborhood’s upper-middle class; in recent years, its membership has decreased, to about seventy-five congregants, many of whom are Latino immigrants. Leading the session was Juan Carlos Ruiz, the church’s Mexican-born pastor. There were roughly a dozen people in attendance. Lines of scripture appeared on the screen in a format resembling a PowerPoint presentation, and each participant was asked to read a passage. A few of them had just recovered from covid-19 themselves.

       <b>Good Friday</b> is a Christian holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus and his death at Calvary. It is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover.

    Kasler is one of the few remaining parishioners whose family belonged to the church’s old guard. He and Ruiz became friends over a weekly church dinner called “Breaking Bread with JC”—“for Juan Carlos,” Ruiz told me. Ruiz is a co-founder of the New Sanctuary Coalition, an advocacy group that organizes in support of immigrant communities throughout the five boroughs. When he started receiving phone calls from immigrants whose family members or friends had died of covid-19, he called Kasler. None of the people whom Ruiz had been speaking with knew who to call to handle the bodies or arrange <ruby>
        last rites<rt>宗教葬禮</rt>
    </ruby>.
   </p>
<p>
    “What do we do?” Ruiz asked.
</p>
<p>
    “Send them to me,” Kasler said.
</p>
   <p>  
    Sherman’s didn’t have the space to deal with more people, and its services, while not nearly among the most expensive in the city, were still costly. “But this isn’t about business,” Kasler told me. “This is about getting people what they need right now.” He called Gerard Lockwood, an old friend who, four decades ago, worked for Kasler’s father. Lockwood is now sixty-five, with his own funeral home and chapel, in Park Slope. He agreed to help, offering to pick up and prepare as many victims as he could.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    On the afternoon of Good Friday, Lockwood spoke on the phone with a translator for a Mexican woman who was trying to bury her forty-three-year-old husband. He was charging the woman about nineteen hundred dollars, the bare minimum. She’d asked if she could give him a thousand-dollar deposit and pay the rest in installments. He agreed, but never bothered to work out a payment plan.<sup>㋡</sup> “In many of these cases, an ambulance takes away a loved one,” he told me. “You can’t communicate with them. You can’t see them. And then, a few days later, you get a phone call saying that your loved one has died. How do you process that?” He added, “There’s going to be a lot of unresolved grief.”

    Lockwood initially allowed the immediate family of the deceased to congregate in his chapel, though he limited the total number of people <ruby>
        on the premises<rt>inside the building</rt>
    </ruby>, including his staff and Lockwood himself, to ten. One family held a service from inside the chapel and used FaceTime to patch in other attendees. Public speaking, he told me, seemed to be harder for mourners at a remove; the speakers couldn’t gauge the reactions of their listeners. At one gathering, a relative had instructed, “You’ll know that I’m finished speaking when I say ‘I love you.’ ”
   </p>
   <p>
    Funeral homes nationwide are experimenting with novel ways to hold services. Earlier this month, in San Antonio, one mortuary held what has been described as the world’s first “drive-in theatre” for funerals. A giant screen was erected in the parking lot. Mourners drove up to a window to view the remains, and used a microphone to record messages for the family.<sup>㋡</sup> In Brooklyn, where even small gatherings have become untenable, Lockwood devised a quieter solution. Since people can’t come in, he calls over a friend, a Jesuit priest who lives across the street, to hold a short service in the chapel on behalf of mourning family members. “Just a few blessings and prayers,” he said. “It’s something we feel we can do for the family, and people are relieved to know that someone is looking after their loved ones even in this small way.”

    One call he received came from a forty-nine-year-old Mexican man named Félix, who lives with his wife and daughter in East Harlem. Félix’s brother, who had lived in New York for more than a decade, contracted covid-19 in early April. He lived in Elmhurst, Queens, and worked in construction. Even with a persistent fever, Félix said, his brother was reluctant to go to the hospital, because “there’s this feeling out there that, if you get taken to a hospital in an ambulance right now, you never come back.”
   </p>

   <p>
    By the time Félix learned the severity of his brother’s condition, he couldn’t visit him, for fear of contaminating his own family. He drove forty minutes to his brother’s apartment to leave medicine outside the door. “He texted me constantly, but never called,” Félix said. “He was too ill to talk.” A few days after Félix had made one of his deliveries, his brother texted to say that he was beginning to feel better. “He never liked to worry us,” Felix said. The next morning, around seven-thirty, his brother died, at home. A few hours later, at the recommendation of a friend, Félix was on the phone with Juan Carlos Ruiz. “Talking to him gave me strength,” Félix told me.

    On April 9th, Félix travelled to Park Slope, to meet Lockwood. He asked if he could accompany his brother’s body when it was transported to the crematorium. The earliest available date was still weeks away. They agreed that Lockwood, Félix, and the pastor of Félix’s church, in Manhattan, would go together, and say a prayer in the crematorium’s parking lot. Only one of them, though—the funeral director—will be allowed inside with the body.
