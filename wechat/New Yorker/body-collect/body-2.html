    <h2 style="padding-bottom: 0.2em;">Sherman’s Flatbush Memorial Chapel.</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="cap">S</span>herman’s Flatbush Memorial Chapel is the oldest Jewish funeral home in Brooklyn. When William Sherman founded it, in Williamsburg, in 1898, he kept a <ruby>
            stable<rt>馬廄</rt>
        </ruby> of horses <ruby>
            on the premises<rt>inside the Chapel</rt>
        </ruby> to transport bodies. Since the late nineteen-nineties, William’s great-grandson, Joe Sherman, has owned the parlor, and it now occupies a sizable lot on Coney Island Avenue in Midwood. The building, a large, brick structure, looks vaguely like a casket, with a flat black awning and a bas-relief of a glowing flame on its façade. Two <ruby>
            hearses<rt>靈車</rt>
        </ruby> sit in the parking lot. Since mid-March, when a grieving family member came in with a cough, only staff members have been allowed inside. “Our main concern now,” Sherman told me, “is protecting the living.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Chris Kasler, a <ruby>
            thickset<rt>身體粗壯</rt>
        </ruby> Bay Ridge native with a heavy New York accent, has been helping to coördinate Sherman’s daily operations. He is genial and warm, with a lively sense of humor and a sober sense of professional responsibility; at fifty-four, he is a pedigreed mortician himself, the son and grandson of funeral directors. “I was born into this work,” he told me. “I grew up in a funeral home. I mean, literally.” When Kasler’s grandmother died, in 2003, at the age of ninety-nine, she was the city’s oldest licensed undertaker, and his two brothers are both certified as funeral directors. One is an E.M.T. at N.Y.U. Langone Hospital, and the other is an executive at the American Academy McAllister Institute of Funeral Service, on West Fifty-fourth Street, in Manhattan.

        At Sherman’s, Kasler had set up a temporary work station on a plastic folding table in the main hallway. Death certificates sat in neat piles alongside a master calendar<sup>㋡</sup>, on which Kasler tracked each case. Early on, the funeral home vowed not to turn away any families in mourning. But there was no way to predict such an intense volume of cases. In the past, a busy week consisted of about twelve funerals. During the first week of April, the funeral home handled more than a hundred and twenty-three bodies.<sup>㋡</sup> Some had to be transported to <ruby>
            cemeteries<rt>不靠近教堂的墓地</rt>
        </ruby>, others to <ruby>
            crematoriums<rt>火葬場</rt>
        </ruby>. Delays at both places—the next available appointments at the city’s crematoriums, for instance, are weeks away—led to a bottleneck. “This place is like a city morgue,” Kasler told me, “only about ten times worse.”

        There wasn’t room to store all the remains. The refrigeration unit could hold up to six adult caskets and roughly four additional bodies that were to be <ruby>
            embalmed<rt>做防腐處理</rt>
        </ruby> or cremated. Kasler was rotating sets of bodies through the unit every three hours, to keep them from decomposing. He had set the air-conditioning system to its lowest level, sixty-four degrees<sup>㋡</sup>, which was still about twenty degrees warmer than it needed to be. Two weeks earlier, Sherman’s suspended funeral services in the chapel, a large, carpeted room with polished wooden <ruby>
            pews<rt>教堂長椅</rt>
        </ruby>. Forty-six bodies were now stored inside. Some of them were in caskets, others were in orange “disaster” pouches<sup>㋡</sup> provided by hospitals, and still more were kept in thin cardboard boxes known as cremation containers. The staff used warning labels to mark the <ruby>
            receptacles<rt>containers</rt>
        </ruby> which contained the remains of those who had died of covid-19. After a few days, a sour odor began to fill the mortuary; when the staff cracked a door to alleviate the smell, flies swarmed in.

        “It’s like we’re in a war zone,” Kasler said. In one corner of the chapel, a large wooden casket sat between an orange body bag and a cardboard box. Other bodies were resting on the pews, or on stands snaking along the walls.<sup>㋡</sup>  One of them was a ninety-year-old woman, who had been wrapped temporarily in a plastic sheet, for lack of a more appropriate container, until Kasler covered her with a large white blanket. He told me, “To somebody, she’s a mother, a sister, a grandmother. I tried to keep her head straight on the pillow.”

        Kasler and his co-workers were also concerned about supplies. They were <ruby>
            running low on<rt>runnign out of</rt>
        </ruby> personal protective equipment—masks, gowns, and gloves. Each house call or hospital visit now required at least three pairs of gloves and two gowns. Zambito and the others needed to <ruby>
            shed<rt>get rid of</rt>
        </ruby> each item as it came into contact with a contaminated body. A standard pickup, she told me, required one set of P.P.E. to retrieve the body, followed by another set to put the body in the van, and yet another to take the body out of the van and bring it into the mortuary. Sherman had begun contacting funeral homes in other states to see if he could buy supplies from them. He was looking for disinfectant sprays and Clorox<sup>❉</sup> wipes. A cousin of his, in California, had ordered some of the items wholesale and arranged for them to be shipped to Sherman in New York. There was also a shortage of caskets. “They can’t make them quick enough,” Sherman told me.

        In the meantime, Kasler said, “We have to wing it.” He had set up two additional tables in the hallway, including one he used exclusively for arranging cremations. The chaos of the scene inside the funeral home, he said, threatened to undermine all of the traditions that had been passed down by his father and grandmother. “The body has to be treated <ruby>
            reverently<rt>with great respect</rt>
        </ruby>,” he told me. “How you honor the dead is how you’re brought up.”<sup>㋡</sup> As he was saying this, he received another call on his cell phone and excused himself. Half an hour later, he sent a text: “My nephew was just rushed to Princeton Hospital. Covid positive. Difficulty breathing.”
