          On the thirty-ninth day of the lockdown, the packages in my lobby included a box of houseplants for <ruby>3703<rt>room number</rt></ruby> and some flowers for 2903. It was now March, and sometimes I saw people on their balconies, tending plants. But it still seemed rare for residents to leave the <ruby>compound<rt>小区</rt></ruby>. When women went downstairs to pick up packages, it wasn’t unusual for them to be dressed in pajamas, even in the afternoon. In the lobby, <ruby>management<rt>小区物业</rt></ruby> provided a spray bottle of seventy-five-per-cent-alcohol solution, and sometimes I saw a masked, <ruby>pajama-clad<rt>pajama-wearing</rt></ruby> resident standing in a puddle of the stuff, spraying her hands, packages, shopping bags, <ruby>whatever<rt>etc.</rt></ruby>.

      People rarely spoke in these situations. <sup style="color: #88C0D0">SP4</sup><u>There were no greetings, no jokes, no moments of commiseration.</u> Part of it was the masks, which were an obsession. On my floor, residents wore them even if they were merely dropping off garbage, ten feet from their door. Mask-wearing, after all, was required by the new measures, and people were diligent: I often saw motorcycle deliverymen helmetless and fiddling with their phones at thirty miles an hour, their masks safely in place. When I went running along the river at dawn, the few other people who were out sometimes shouted at me for being bare-faced. Ariel and Natasha despised the things, and I gave them permission to go with the low-rider—this is when you pretend that you are obeying the rules but actually tug the mask down so that your nostrils are uncovered.

      Health-care professionals told me that masks have no value in uncrowded outdoor settings, where infection isn’t a risk, and most people wore them improperly even when they weren’t holstering or low-riding. <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>The notion of these things playing a <ruby>talismanic<rt>护身符般的</rt></ruby> role isn’t new.</u> In “<ruby>The Plague<rt>《鼠疫》</rt></ruby>,” published in 1947, Albert Camus described two characters in a hospital:

    <p class="quotes">
      He opened one and took two gauze masks out of a sterilizer, offered one to Rambert and asked him to put it on. The journalist asked if it served any purpose and Tarrou said no, but that it inspired confidence in others.

      Masks also make it easier for people to ignore one another.<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup> If residents passed me in the courtyard, they avoided eye contact;<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❷</sup> some wore see-through plastic gloves and surgical booties in addition to the masks.<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❸</sup> These costumes of the quarantine, along with all the other restrictions, helped turn citizens inward, and people directed their energy toward whatever space was left to them. Among the packages in my lobby, I noticed many home furnishings and cleaning implements: a Pincai-brand storage cabinet for 602, a Deema vacuum cleaner for 2304, a giant carpet, wrapped in tape and plastic, for 303. There was home-office equipment (wireless mouse, 4201; file cabinets, 301). By the forty-fourth day, somebody in 3704 had felt the need to buy an electric footbath machine from Kosaka.

        Kosaka footbath machine 是小阪牌电足浴，搜不到官网，只有京东和淘宝上有商品在卖。日本官网也没有搜到，疑似贴牌产品。后面的 Powerful by Dreams 我也没有搜到，只能猜是包装上的字样。

      From what I could tell, the lockdown diet of my neighbors was remarkably healthy. If quarantined Americans were forced to survive on delivery food, health officials would want to track the X curve of <ruby>body-mass index<rt>身体质量指数</rt></ruby><sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup> rising across the drop in coronavirus cases. In Chengdu, though, my neighbors were obviously cooking: lots of fresh vegetables and fruit. I never saw evidence of alcohol going anywhere other than 1901: my apartment. The government had strategically allowed cigarette and alcohol shops to remain open—these were among the very few places of business that never shut down.<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❷</sup> But, when I talked to store owners in my neighborhood, they said that sales were terrible. There are many types of loneliness in this world, but it’s a unique sensation to feel that you are the only individual in a forty-three-story building who is drinking his way through a quarantine.

        X curve 一般是一个指标向下走，另一个指标对应地向上走，形成 X 状轨迹。"forced", "track" 这样的词多少有点讽刺的意味。和 "remarkably healthy" 形成对比。

      I seldom saw children. I knew they were up there:<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup> a Mini Table Football game to 2703, a Huanqi toybox to 1804. The compound printed out documents on request, and sometimes the lobby contained homework assignments for kids who were attending school online: for 2102, a chapter on chemistry; for 3802, a handout on poems from the Northern and Southern dynasties. But, in the early weeks of the lockdown, children didn’t even venture into the courtyard, because parents were so frightened of the disease. I had no idea what they were doing for exercise. Even with our trips to the bikes and the subway station, I usually put my daughters on our treadmill every three days or so. In Wuhan, Zhang the pharmacist<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❷</sup> was also doing the best he could:

    <p class="quotes">
      People who spend a lot of time in a confined space tend to become lazy and depressed. It’s not easy to motivate them. I’m now teaching my daughter to practice Ping-Pong against the living-room wall. My childhood school didn’t have so many Ping-Pong tables. We used to do that a lot. Now she is quite skilled at it. Other times, I encourage her to stand up and play the guitar, moving to the beat, like a real band guitarist.
