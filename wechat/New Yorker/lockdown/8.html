Such details had a way of getting out, and I observed people behaving in ways that seemed unusually vigilant around the building in question<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup>. Once, a woman wearing a mask, plastic gloves, surgical booties, and pajamas walked past me holding a package, a bottle of disinfectant, and a cotton swab. I saw her enter the building and gingerly use the swab to call the elevator, so that even her gloved hand didn’t touch the button.

      One afternoon, I went up to the apartment, where I heard voices behind the numbered door. A rack of shoes outside: at least one child lived here. I knocked, and a man called out in a gruff voice, “Who is it?”
    </p>

    <p>
      I explained that I was a neighbor, and the man opened the door. He was middle-aged, with the kind of paunch that in China is often associated with business careers. He was wearing clear plastic gloves and smoking a cigarette. I introduced myself and said that I had been told a resident had had the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nobody here has had it,” the man said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to put him at ease, explaining that I understood that the case had been mild, and that I just wanted to learn about the recovery process.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course,” he said. “If I were a neighbor, and if somebody had been sick, I’d want to know, too. But nobody here has had it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So you’ve never heard of anybody in this building getting infected?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” he said. His face was unmasked, but I couldn’t read anything in his expression. He politely said goodbye and closed the door. On the way down, the elevator reeked of seventy-five-per-cent-alcohol disinfectant.

    padding-top: 5px;">O</span>n the forty-fifth day of the lockdown, our family went out to dinner for the first time. Businesses had slowly started to open, according to the logic of the Party. Barbershops were among the first, probably because there was no online alternative. Banks came later, and then a barbecue place across the river opened its doors. My daughters still hadn’t interacted with another child their age<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup>, and there had been no announcement about school.

  At the restaurant, the hostess shot Ariel and Natasha with an infrared gun, and then Leslie and I took our turn. The hostess carried a clipboard on which we wrote our names, cell-phone numbers, and temperatures: Ariel, 36.5; Natasha, 36.2; Leslie, 36.2; me, 36.0. We sat down and unmasked. This place had always been popular, but tonight it was half full. Across China, there had been more than eighty thousand confirmed cases and 3,119 deaths, but the rate of increase in both figures had slowed dramatically. Chengdu’s last death—its third, total—had happened more than three weeks before. The three victims had been aged sixty-four, seventy-three, and eighty, and all had suffered multiple chronic health problems before becoming infected.
</p>
<p>
  The restaurant was trying hard. After we ordered, a manager called me over with what I believe to have been a conspiratorial smile, although only his eyes were visible. He handed me a silver tray with a sprig of flowers, a bowl of glutinous rice, and a red Valentine’s-style card.
</p>
<p>
  “It’s March 8th!” he said.
</p>
<p>
  I had forgotten—International Women’s Day.
</p>
<p>
  He pointed at the rice and the card. “It’s free,” he said. “Write a message to your wife!”
</p>
<p>
  I stared at the red paper. Then I wrote something to the effect that this was the most romantic period we had shared since the 2013 coup in Cairo<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup>. I walked back to the table carrying the silver tray while the masked manager took pictures with his cell phone. A waitress brought the bottle of beer we had ordered, and I filled Leslie’s and my glasses. Soon, the waitress reappeared with another Tsingtao. “It’s free,” she said. “Because of the epidemic!” She opened the bottle and we shared that one, too. ♦
