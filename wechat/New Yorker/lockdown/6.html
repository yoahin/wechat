At our daughters’ school, for the first three weeks of the semester there were no online classes for the younger grades, although they were given some materials, including a school project titled “The Coronavirus and Everybody’s Battle Against the Epidemic.” Then the school started holding short lessons online, but <ruby>Leslie<rt>作者的妻子</rt></ruby><sup>❉</sup> and I thought that children of that age shouldn’t be engaged in remote learning.

      We organized things as best we could, using the school’s assignments and finding other projects. Ariel and Natasha usually worked well in the morning, and then, around ten or eleven o’clock, when we started to hear sounds of roughhousing, I took them out for our morning walk. In the afternoon, we sent them to play in the compound courtyard, where it was common for passersby to lecture them about the dangers of being outdoors or of wearing their masks improperly. The latter criticism probably should have been directed at me, because I had made the mistake of telling the twins about the flapjack<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup>, in which you allow the mask to dangle from one ear in order to answer a cell phone on the other side.

      In a four-room apartment, with one adult writing a book and another teaching full time, none of this seemed sustainable, but we had made the decision to stay. The girls’ foreign friends had all been evacuated at the beginning of the quarantine, and the families of their Chinese classmates weren’t meeting with anybody. All over the city, children remained isolated.

      I suspected that this was particularly hard on middle- and high-school students. Young people in general suffer significant stress in China, where suicide is the leading cause of death among those aged between fifteen and thirty-five. In the nineteen-nineties, I was an instructor at a teachers’ college in Fuling, a small city less than three hundred miles east of Chengdu, and most of my students now teach in middle and high schools. They often live in third- and fourth-tier cities, where the shift to remote education seemed problematic. “As for the classes online, it couldn’t be much worse,” a high-school teacher wrote me. “The students can’t control themselves.” He said that all his students followed lessons on mobile phones, which seems common in smaller cities, where families often don’t believe that a spare laptop or tablet is necessary. And it requires significant discipline to focus on online lesson1.<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">[1]</sup> My current students seemed to handle the adjustment well, but they are at one of China’s better universities, and all of them have computers.

      As March progressed, certain aspects of the lockdown eased, and many people began to return to work. It was similar to the idea that Marc Lipsitch had described: letting the air out of the balloon slowly. But schools weren’t part of this process, which meant that many children remained at home alone after their parents went to work. Willy, a former student who now teaches in Zhejiang Province, estimated that eighty per cent of his ninth-grade pupils were unaccompanied during the day.

      Parents often called him to complain. “People say their kids are shenshou,” he said, using a word that means, roughly, “mystical beasts.” “They say, ‘We want the mystical beast to go back to the cage.’ The cages are the school.” He described the family situation of one of his colleagues: “His son had been good, and he was hardworking. But in the past forty or fifty days he has been doing online courses, and he spends so much time online. His father said he’s very likely to lose his temper. He goes crazy. He shouts.<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup> It’s because of using the mobile phone too much.” Willy’s own two children also had classes on phones, and he had noticed a rapid deterioration in his teen-age daughter’s behavior. “We don’t know exactly when she is having class and when she is using the mobile phone to chat or play games,” he said. “She is right now out of control.”

      <p>整段大多用了过去式描述已经发生的事情，这里却用了一般现在时，为什么？我的理解如下：</p>
      <p>在体育赛事报道中，播报员喜欢用一般现在时，传递一种就发生在此时此刻的<b>临场感</b>。</p>
      <p>这种临场感的表现，在悬疑剧里体现的最为明显：当侦探讲解案情时，常见的拍摄手法是镜头闪回案发当时。既然回到案发当时，那一切都是以<b>案发当时</b>为基准的一般现在时了。</p>
      <p>
        这里用现在时，这位父亲因孩子发火的形象就跃然纸上了。只是非母语读者天然缺失这种语感。
