Over all, more than eighty per cent of known cases show only mild to moderate symptoms; older people are much more likely to develop serious cases, especially if they suffer from other health problems. According to the W.H.O., by February 20th, children under the age of nineteen represented only 2.4 per cent of the reported cases in China. Of the few children who get sick, the cases tend to be mild. Last week, Pediatrics<sup>❉</sup> released a <span class="ft-con">study</span><sup style="color: #B48EAD;">[1,2]</sup> showing that, in a set of seven hundred and thirty-one confirmed cases of coronavirus among children, ninety-seven per cent were asymptomatic, or had mild or moderate symptoms. Thus far, in all of China, there has been only one death in this age group, a fourteen-year-old boy.

  Fisher, the infectious-disease specialist from Singapore who accompanied the W.H.O. mission, told me that he opposes school closings. From the early case studies, Fisher predicts that children get infected at the same rate as adults yet tend to show mild symptoms or be asymptomatic. And although there is evidence of asymptomatic transmission, such events seem unusual and, in the analysis of the W.H.O., have not played a major role in the spread of the disease.
</p>

<p>
  But a more difficult issue is presymptomatic transmission. There seems to be a brief window—perhaps two or three days—when people are infectious but not yet showing symptoms. Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, told me that he believes between twenty and forty per cent of infections come from people who don’t yet seem sick. “They could be spreading it through droplets, <ruby>say<rt>for example</rt></ruby> during eating or speaking,” he said. “These droplets could contaminate surfaces, and this is how it spreads.”
</p>

<p>
  The role that children play in this process remains unclear. Fisher pointed out that there’s no evidence<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup> that they have helped spread the disease in China or elsewhere. The W.H.O. report noted that, during the mission’s nine-day trip, none of the Chinese medical personnel who were interviewed could recall a case in which transmission occurred from a child to an adult.

  “My view on schools is that children aren’t at risk of severe disease,” Fisher said. “They don’t amplify the spread, they don’t amplify the transmission. They are kind of bystanders while it goes on. There’s no good reason to keep them out of school, unless the society is in<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup> total lockdown. I’d rather see just a modification of school activities.”

  But Leung cautioned that nothing is definitive at this point. He was currently analyzing how the disease spreads within households, which could reveal information about which ages are most infectious, but he wouldn’t finish until later this month. He thought that an ongoing Chinese analysis of <ruby>serology<rt>血清学</rt></ruby>, or antibody patterns, could provide some clearer answers to the question of children’s role in the epidemic. But this research would probably take at least a few more weeks.
</p>

<p>
  Leung noted that, in the absence of clear science, political pressures have a large influence on school closures. Hong Kong closed schools, but Singapore did not, relying instead on measures that more carefully limited and screened arrivals, used targeted testing, isolated known cases, and protected high-risk groups. Taiwan followed a similar strategy, allowing schools to reopen after a two-week extension of the Lunar New Year holiday. All three places seem to have managed the situation effectively. The Centers for Disease Control in the United States has noted that countries that closed schools at an early stage <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>have not necessarily</u> handled the epidemic better than those which didn’t, and such closures likely have to be longer than four weeks to have any benefit.

  In the short term, China’s <ruby>all-out<rt>complete</rt></ruby> lockdown wasn’t surprising after the country caught a glimpse of the abyss in Wuhan. But, as time passed, there didn’t seem to be much evolution in strategy. “We have to fully have a conversation about the cost,” Nuzzo, the epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, told me. In her opinion, the extremely positive W.H.O. report had missed an opportunity to point out some negative impacts of the Chinese strategy.
</p>

<p>
  She noted that the virus can always return, and that it will probably take one or two years to develop a vaccine. In her opinion, instead of relying on overwhelming measures, the Chinese should develop strategies that might be more flexible and sustainable. The effects of enforced <ruby>seclusion<rt>isolation</rt></ruby>, stressed children, and distrust of neighbors <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>can’t be quantified as easily and as quickly as cases of infection and death.</u> Even many things that can be counted are simply not prioritized at such a time. I had a feeling that people would be shocked if they knew how many Chinese schoolchildren—many tens of millions, undoubtedly—are currently being educated entirely through mobile phones.

  Some critical numbers remain unknown for other reasons. During the fourth week of online classes, a friend in Fuling reported that a teen-ager in the northern part of the city had jumped out of his fifth-floor apartment. Apparently, the middle-school student had been fighting with his father, who was trying to get him to focus on his online lessons. My friend sent me a cell-phone video taken by somebody who lived nearby.
</p>

<p>
  In the video, two people crouch over a motionless form at the base of a building. Police cars have arrived, along with an ambulance; three men in masks approach with a stretcher. Bystanders engage in a terse dialogue:
</p>

<p class="quotes">
  “The feet hit the ground first.”<br>
  “How can the family take this? My God! This is so sad.”<br>
  “Jumped from the fifth floor, right?”<br>
  “The fifth floor.”
</p>

<p>
  This single incident in one small city equalled the nationwide death total from the coronavirus in children under the age of nineteen. Earlier this month, there was at least one other suicide, when an elementary-school student in Hebei Province, having been scolded for using his phone to watch videos instead of for remote classes, jumped from a building. If such things were happening elsewhere, they were probably kept quiet. There was no report in the Fuling press, and, if anything was posted on social media, it was quickly taken down. “The online classes are like a campaign that we have to win, just like we must defeat the virus,” my friend explained. “So this kind of thing should not drag it down. This is why I can’t find the information about the incident online, I think.”
