        <span class="cap">I</span> should explain a little about my father’s background. His father, Benshiki Murakami, was born into a farming family in <ruby>
            Aichi Prefecture<rt>愛知県</rt>
        </ruby>. As was common with younger sons, my grandfather was sent to a nearby temple to train as a priest. He was a decent student, and after apprenticeships at various temples he was appointed head priest of the <ruby>
            Anyoji Temple<rt>安養寺</rt>
        </ruby>, in <ruby>
            Kyoto<rt>京都</rt>
        </ruby>. This temple has four or five hundred families in its <ruby>
            parish<rt>教區</rt>
        </ruby>, so it was quite a promotion for him.
    </p>

<p>
    I grew up in the <ruby>
        Osaka-Kobe<rt>大阪—神戶</rt>
    </ruby> area, so I didn’t have many opportunities to visit my grandfather’s home, this Kyoto temple, and I have few memories of him. What I understand, though, is that he was a free, uninhibited sort of person, known for his love of drinking. As his name implies—the character ben in his first name means “eloquence”—he <ruby>
        had a way with <rt>was able to handle well</rt>
    </ruby> words; he was a capable priest, and was apparently popular. I do recall that he was charismatic, with a booming voice.
</p>

<p>
    My grandfather had six sons (not a single daughter) and was a healthy, hearty man, but, sadly, when he was seventy, at eight-fifty on the morning of August 25, 1958, he was struck by a train while crossing the tracks of the Keishin Line<sup>❉</sup>, which connects <ruby>
        Kyoto (Misasagi)<rt>京都（御陵）</rt>
    </ruby> and <ruby>
        Otsu<rt>大津市</rt>
    </ruby>, and killed. It was an unattended railway crossing in <ruby>
        Yamada-cho<rt>山田市</rt>
    </ruby>, <ruby>
        Kitahanayama<rt>北區花山台</rt>
    </ruby>, <ruby>
        Yamashina<rt>山科區</rt>
    </ruby>, in <ruby>
        Higashiyama-ku<rt>東山區</rt>
    </ruby>. A large typhoon hit the Kinki region<sup>❉</sup> on this particular day; it was raining hard, my grandfather was carrying an umbrella, and he probably didn’t see the train coming around a curve. He was a bit <ruby>
        hard of hearing<rt>not able to hear well</rt>
    </ruby> as well.

    The night our family learned that my grandfather had died, I remember my father quickly preparing to go to Kyoto, and <u><sup class="pattern">SP12</sup>my mother crying, clinging to him, pleading, “Whatever you do, don’t agree to take over the temple.”</u><sup>㋡</sup> I was only nine at the time, but this image is etched in my brain, like a memorable scene from a black-and-white movie. <u><sup class="pattern">SP12</sup>My father was expressionless, silently nodding.</u> I think he’d already made up his mind. I could sense it.

    My father was born on December 1, 1917, in <ruby>
        Awata-guchi<rt>粟田口</rt>
    </ruby>, Sakyo-ku, in Kyoto<sup>❉</sup>. When he was a boy, <u><sup class="pattern">SP4</sup>
        the peaceful Taisho<sup>❉</sup> democracy period was <ruby>
            drawing to a close<rt>about to end</rt>
        </ruby>, to be followed by the gloomy Great Depression, then the swamp<sup>㋡</sup> that was the Second Sino-Japanese War, and, finally, the tragedy of the Second World War.
    </u> Then came the confusion and poverty of the early postwar period, when my father’s generation struggled to survive. As I mentioned, my father was one of six brothers. Three of them had been <ruby>
        drafted<rt>conscript</rt>
    </ruby> and fought in the Second Sino-Japanese War and, miraculously, survived with no serious injuries. Almost all of the six sons were more or less qualified to be priests. They had that kind of education. My father, for instance, held a junior rank as a priest, roughly equivalent to that of a second lieutenant in the military. 
        In the summer, during the busy <ruby>
            obon season<rt>孟于藍盆會</rt>
        </ruby> —the yearly festival to honor family ancestors—these six brothers would assemble in Kyoto and divide up the visits to the temple’s parishioners. At night, they’d get together and drink.

        <b>Taishō era</b> (大正, Taishō) is a period in the history of Japan dating from 30 July 1912 to 25 December 1926, coinciding with the reign of the Emperor Taishō.

    <p>
        The new emperor was a sickly man, which prompted the shift in political power from the old oligarchic group of elder statesmen (or <i>genrō</i> (元老) ) to the Imperial Diet (國會) of Japan and the democratic parties.

        Thus, the era is considered the time of the liberal movement known as the "<b>Taishō democracy</b>" in Japan; it is usually distinguished from the preceding chaotic <b>Meiji</b> (明治) period and the following militaristic-driven first part of the <b>Shōwa</b> (昭和) period.

    After my grandfather died, there was the pressing question of who would take over the priestly duties at the temple. Most of the sons were already married and had jobs. Truth be told, no one had expected my grandfather to pass away so early or so suddenly.
</p>

<p>
    <u><sup class="pattern">SP7</sup>The eldest son—my uncle Shimei Murakami—had wanted to become a veterinarian</u>, but after the war he took a job at the tax office in Osaka and was now a subsection chief, while my father, the second son, taught Japanese at the combined Koyo Gakuin junior and senior high school<sup>❉</sup> in the <ruby>
        Kansai area<rt>関西地方</rt>
    </ruby>. The other brothers were either teachers, too, or studying in Buddhist-affiliated colleges. Two of the brothers had been adopted by other families, a common practice, and had different last names. At any rate, when they met to discuss the situation no one volunteered to take on the temple duties. Becoming the head priest of a large temple like that was <ruby>
        no easy undertaking<rt>a demanding task to take</rt>
    </ruby>, and would be a major burden for anyone’s family. The brothers knew this all too well. And my grandmother, a widow now, was a strict, no-nonsense type; any wife would have found it difficult to serve as the head priest’s spouse with her still there. My mother was the eldest daughter of an established merchant family in Senba, in Osaka. She was a fashionable woman, not at all the type to fit in as the head priest’s wife in Kyoto. So it was no wonder she clung to my father, in tears, begging him not to take over the temple.<sup>㋡</sup>

    At least from my perspective, as his son, my father seemed to be a straightforward, responsible person. He hadn’t inherited his father’s openhearted <ruby>

    </ruby> (he was more the nervous type), but his good-natured manner and his way of speaking put other people at ease. He had a sincere faith as well. He probably would have <ruby>

    </ruby>. And, later, he was succeeded by his son, my cousin Junichi. According to Junichi, Shimei agreed to become the head priest <ruby>
