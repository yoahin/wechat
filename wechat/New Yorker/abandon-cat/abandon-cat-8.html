    According to my mother, my father in his younger days lived a pretty wild life. His wartime experiences were fresh then, and his frustration at the fact that his life hadn’t gone the way he’d wanted it to made things hard at times. He drank a lot, and occasionally hit his students. But by the time I was growing up he’d <ruby>
        mellowed<rt>mature; soften</rt>
    </ruby> significantly. He’d get depressed and <ruby>
        out of sorts<rt>ill/sick or upset</rt>
    </ruby> sometimes, and drink too much (something my mother often complained about), but I don’t recall any unpleasant experiences in our home.
</p>

<p>
    Objectively speaking, I think my father was an excellent teacher. When he died, I was surprised at how many of his former students came to pay their respects. They seemed to have a great deal of affection for him. Many of them had become doctors, and they took very good care of him as he battled cancer and diabetes.

    My mother was apparently an outstanding teacher <ruby>
        in her own right<rt>as a result of her own ability</rt>
    </ruby>, and even after she had me and became a full-time housewife many of her former pupils would stop by the house. For some reason, though, I never felt that I was <ruby>
        cut out to be<rt>naturally able/suited to be</rt>
    </ruby> a teacher.
