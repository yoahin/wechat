        <span class="cap">I</span> have one more memory from childhood that involves a cat. I included this episode in one of my novels but would like to <ruby>
            touch on<rt>briefly mention</rt>
        </ruby> it again here, as something that actually happened.
    </p>

<p>
    We had a little white kitten. I don’t recall how we came to have it, because back then we always had cats coming and going in our home. But I do recall how pretty this kitten’s fur was, how cute it was.
</p>

<p>
    One evening, as I sat on the porch, this cat suddenly raced straight up into the tall, beautiful pine tree in our garden. Almost as if it wanted to show off to me how brave and agile it was. I couldn’t believe how nimbly it <ruby>
        scampered<rt>run fast with short light steps</rt>
    </ruby> up the trunk and disappeared into the upper branches. After a while, the kitten started to meow pitifully, as though it were begging for help. It had had no trouble climbing up so high, but it seemed terrified of climbing back down.
</p>

<p>
    I stood at the base of the tree looking up, but couldn’t see the cat. I could only hear its faint cry. I went to get my father and told him what had happened, hoping that he could figure out a way to rescue the kitten. But there was nothing he could do; it was too high up for a ladder to be of any use. The kitten kept meowing for help, as the sun began to set. Darkness finally enveloped the pine tree.
</p>

<p>
    I don’t know what happened to that little kitten. The next morning when I got up, I couldn’t hear it crying anymore. I stood at the base of the tree and called out the kitten’s name, but there was no reply. <u><sup class="pattern">SP20</sup>Just silence</u>.

<p>
    Perhaps the cat had <ruby>
        made it down<rt>managed to get down the tree</rt>
    </ruby> sometime during the night and gone off somewhere (but where?). Or maybe, unable to climb down, it had clung to the branches, exhausted, and grown weaker and weaker until it died. I sat there on the porch, gazing up at the tree, with these scenarios running through my mind. Thinking of that little white kitten clinging on for dear life with its tiny claws, then <ruby>
        shrivelled up<rt>枯萎</rt>
    </ruby> and dead.
</p>

<p>
    The experience taught me a vivid lesson: going down is much harder than going up. To generalize from this, you might say that results overwhelm causes and neutralize them. <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>In some cases, a cat is killed in the process; in other cases, a human being.</u><sup>㋡</sup>

        Sometimes, in the process of an event, a cat is killed; sometimes, in the process of such an event, a human being is killed.

  從維基百科中瞭解到，他的作品中反復出現的主題，是一種卡夫卡式、詭異的疏離與孤獨。

        可愛的小貓獨自凄慘地死在大樹高頭，村上固執地這麽想象著，正是體現之一吧。我縂感覺小貓咪是村上對自己的比喻，他長大后沒有爬下去到父親的世界多看看。

        這一段說結果往往比過程原因。而在原因導向結果的過程裏，逝去的是生命。

        動物給人上一課，這是寓言故事的經典模式。我印象深刻的是 <i>Life of Pi</i> 裏父親教年少的 Pi 認識老虎的凶險那一幕。
