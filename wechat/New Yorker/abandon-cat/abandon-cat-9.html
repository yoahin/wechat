        After I got married and started working, my father and I grew even more estranged. And when I became a full-time writer our relationship got so convoluted that in the end we cut off nearly all contact. We didn’t see each other for more than twenty years, and spoke only when it was absolutely necessary.
    </p>

<p>
    My father and I were born into different ages and environments, and our ways of thinking and viewing the world were miles apart. If at a certain point I’d attempted to rebuild our relationship, things might have gone in another direction, <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>but I was too focussed on what I wanted to do to make the effort.</u>

        but I focussed too much on what I wanted to do, so I had no time/energy to make the effort to rebuild my relationship with my father.

    My father and I finally talked face to face shortly before he died. I was almost sixty, my father ninety. He was in a hospital in Nishijin<sup>❉</sup>, in Kyoto. He had terrible diabetes, and cancer was ravaging much of his body. Though he’d always been <ruby>
        on the stout side<rt>brave and determined</rt>
    </ruby>, now he was <ruby>
        gaunt<rt>消瘦憔悴</rt>
    </ruby>. I barely recognized him. And there, in the final days of his life—the very final few days—my father and I managed an awkward conversation and reached a sort of reconciliation. Despite our differences, looking at my <ruby>
        emaciated<rt>ill thin and weak</rt>
    </ruby> father I did feel a connection, a bond between us.

        <b>Nishijin</b> (西陣) is a district in Kamigyō-ku (上京區), Kyoto, Japan. It is well known for the traditional textile produced there, more narrowly referred to as <i>Nishijin-ori</i> (西陣織).

    Even now, I can relive the shared puzzlement of that summer day when we rode together on his bike to the beach at Koroen to abandon a <ruby>
        striped<rt>毛髮有斑紋的</rt>
    </ruby> cat, <u><sup class="pattern">SP9</sup>a cat that totally got the better of us</u><sup>㋡</sup>. I can recall the sound of the waves, the scent of the wind whistling through the stand of pines. It’s the accumulation of insignificant things like this that has made me the person I am.
