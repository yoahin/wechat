        </ruby> here. A single, obvious fact:
    </p>

<p>
    I am the ordinary son of an ordinary man. Which<sup>㋡</sup> is pretty self-evident, I know. But, as I started to unearth that fact, it became clear to me that everything that had happened in my father’s life and in my life was accidental. We live our lives this way: viewing things that came about through accident and <ruby>
        happenstance<rt>sth that happened by chance</rt>
    </ruby> as the sole possible reality.

        <i>which</i> 就是指代上一句，這個用法很特別，并不是常見的非限定定語從句的用法。<i>Collins</i> 詞典裏可以查到這一點。

    To put it another way, imagine raindrops falling on a broad stretch of land. Each one of us is a nameless raindrop among countless drops. A discrete, individual drop, for sure, but one that’s entirely replaceable. Still, <u><sup class="pattern">SP9a</sup>that solitary raindrop has its own emotions, its own history, its own duty to carry on that history.</u> Even if it loses its individual integrity and is absorbed into a collective something. Or maybe precisely because it’s absorbed into a larger, collective entity.<sup>㋡</sup>

       按照語法來看，這兩句並不算完整的句子，語義上來看，它們是上一句的狀語。這種寫法在文學段落裏很常見，有一種詩歌般的節奏感。
    </p>
    <p>
        這是全文的最後一部分，也是記敘文六要素之外的感想作結部分。可能是受信佛父親的影響，村上以雨滴比人生，寫出了禪味，有幾分機緣。

    Occasionally, my mind takes me back to that looming pine tree in the garden of our house in Shukugawa. To thoughts of that little kitten, still clinging to a branch, its body turning to bleached bones.<sup>㋡</sup> And I think of death, and how very difficult it is to climb straight down to the ground, so far below you that it makes your head spin. ♦

       詞句本該以逗號直接跟著前句，由松樹想起那隻小貓。但是第二個 to 卻單獨成句了。這種寫法讓句子像詩一樣流動。散文的美感在於句子的節奏感，不在於複雜的用詞。
    </p>
    <p>
        its body turning to bleached bones 這一句是獨立主格結構，句型 18。
    </p>

    <p>
        最後一句呼應前文的核心觀點：往下走太難，讓人頭暈目眩。
