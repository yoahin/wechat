    At least this was how I understood it for the longest time, but when I looked more deeply into his background I found that I was wrong. In fact, my father belonged not to the 20th Infantry Regiment but to the 16th Transport Regiment, which was also part of the 16th Division. And this regiment wasn’t in Fukuchiyama but was headquartered in <ruby>
        Fukakusa / Fushimi<rt>深草 / 伏見</rt>
    </ruby>, in Kyoto City. So why was I under the impression that my father had belonged to the 20th Infantry Regiment? I’ll discuss this point later<sup>㋡</sup>.

    The 20th Infantry Regiment was known for being one of the first to arrive in Nanjing after the city fell. Military units from Kyoto were generally seen as well bred and urbane, but this particular regiment’s actions gave it a surprisingly bloody reputation. For a long time, I was afraid that my father had participated in the attack on Nanjing, and I was reluctant to investigate the details<sup>㋡</sup>. <u><sup class="pattern">SP18</sup>He died, in August, 2008, at the age of ninety, without my ever having asked him about it, without his ever having talked about it.</u>

    My father was drafted in August of 1938. The 20th Infantry Regiment’s infamous march into Nanjing took place the previous year, in December of 1937, so my father had missed it by nearly a year. When I learned this, it was a tremendous relief, as if a great weight had been lifted<sup>㋡</sup>.

    As a <ruby>
        private second class<rt>二等兵</rt>
    </ruby> in the 16th Transport Regiment, my father boarded a troop transport in Ujina Harbor<sup>❉</sup> on October 3, 1938, and arrived in Shanghai on October 6th. There his regiment joined up with the 20th Infantry Regiment. According to the Army’s wartime directory, the 16th Transport Regiment was primarily assigned to supply and security duties. If you follow the regiment’s movements, you see that it covered incredible distances for the time.
        For units that were barely motorized, and lacked sufficient fuel—horses were the main mode of transportation—travelling so far must have been extremely <ruby>
            arduous<rt>taking a lot of effort</rt>
        </ruby>. <u><sup class="pattern">SP3+1</sup>The situation at the front was dire: supplies couldn’t get there; there was a chronic shortage of <ruby>
            rations<rt>(戰時給軍人的)口糧</rt>
        </ruby> and ammunition; the men’s uniforms were <ruby>
            in tatters<rt>badly worn</rt>
        </ruby>; and unsanitary conditions led to outbreaks of <ruby>
            cholera<rt>霍亂</rt>
        </ruby> and other infectious diseases.</u> It was impossible for Japan, with its limited strength, to control a huge country like China. Even though the Japanese Army was able to gain military control of one city after another, it was, <ruby>
        practically speaking<rt>to tell the truth</rt>
    </ruby>, incapable of occupying entire regions. The memoirs written by soldiers in the 20th Infantry Regiment give a clear picture of how pitiful the situation was. Transport troops were not usually directly involved in front-line fighting, but that didn’t mean they were safe. As they were only lightly armed (usually with just <ruby>
        bayonets<rt>槍上的刺刀</rt>
    </ruby>), when the enemy attacked from the rear they suffered major casualties.

    Soon after starting at the Seizan school, my father had discovered the pleasures of haiku<sup>❉</sup> and joined a haiku circle. He was really into it, to use a modern idiom. Several of the haiku he wrote while he was a soldier were published in the school’s haiku journal; most likely he mailed them to the school from the front:

        <b>Haiku</b> (俳句) (plural <i>haiku</i>) is a short form of Japanese poetry in three phrases, typically characterized by three qualities: 
        <ol>
            <li style="color: unset; padding: 0.3em 0">The essence of haiku is "cutting" (<i>kiru</i>). This is often represented by the juxtaposition of two images or ideas and a <i>kireji</i> ("cutting word") between them, a kind of verbal punctuation mark which signals the moment of separation and colours the manner in which the juxtaposed elements are related.</li>
            <li style="color: unset; padding: 0.3em 0">Traditional haiku often consist of 17 <i>on</i> (音) (also known as <i>morae</i> (duration of a short syllable) though often loosely translated as "syllables"), in three phrases of 5, 7, and 5 on, respectively.</li>
            <li style="color: unset; padding: 0.3em 0">A <i>kigo</i> (seasonal reference, 季語), usually drawn from a <i>saijiki</i> (year-time chronicle 歳時記), an extensive but defined list of such terms.</li>

    My father had been studying, no doubt conscientiously, to become a priest. But a simple clerical error had turned him into a soldier. He went through brutal basic training, was handed a Type 38 rifle, placed on a troop-transport ship, and sent off to the fearsome battles at the front. His unit was constantly on the move, clashing with Chinese troops and <ruby>
        guerrillas<rt>游擊隊</rt>
    </ruby> who put up a fierce resistance. In every way imaginable, this was the opposite of life in a peaceful temple in the Kyoto hills. He must have suffered tremendous mental confusion and spiritual turmoil. In the midst of all that, writing haiku may have been his sole consolation. <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>Things he never could have written in his letters, or <ruby>
            they<rt>things that</rt>

           跟隨兵團漂泊不定，戰火連連，每天都有喪命的風險，自然很少有機會寫下所見所思所想。即便寫了，怕是也寄不出去。俳句成了那可怖歲月裏爲數不多的精神安慰。
