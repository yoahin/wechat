        My father talked to me about the war only once, when he told me a story about how his unit had executed a captured Chinese soldier. I don’t know what <ruby>
            prompted him to<rt>caused him want to</rt>
        </ruby> tell me this. It happened so long ago that it’s an isolated memory, the context unclear. I was still in the lower grades in elementary school. He related <ruby>
            matter-of-factly<rt>unemotionally</rt>
        </ruby> how the execution had taken place. Though the Chinese soldier knew that he was going to be killed, he didn’t struggle, didn’t show any fear, but just sat there quietly with his eyes closed. And he was <ruby>
            decapitated<rt>beheaded</rt>
        </ruby>. The man’s attitude was <ruby>
            exemplary<rt>good enough to be admired</rt>
        </ruby>, my father told me. He seemed to have deep feelings of respect for the Chinese soldier. I don’t know if he had to watch as other soldiers in his unit carried out the execution, or if he himself was forced to play a direct role. There’s no way now to determine whether this is because my memory is <ruby>
            hazy<rt>vague</rt>
        </ruby>, or whether my father described the incident in intentionally vague terms. But one thing is clear: the experience left feelings of anguish and torment that lingered for a long time in the soul of <ruby>
            this priest turned soldier<rt>this priest who became a soldier</rt>
        </ruby>.

    At the time, it wasn’t at all uncommon to allow new soldiers and recruits to practice killing by executing captured Chinese soldiers. Killing unarmed prisoners was, of course, a violation of international law, but the Japanese military in that period seemed to take the practice for granted.<sup>㋡</sup> Military units likely didn’t have the resources to take care of prisoners. Most of these executions were performed either by shooting the prisoner or by stabbing him with a bayonet, but I recall my father telling me that for this particular execution a <ruby>
        sword<rt>武士刀</rt>
    </ruby> was used.

        This reminds me of a book I flipped through a few years ago. The book is on Killing in War and the author thinks too muck killing brutalizes soldiers so much so that some of them will kill like they are doing a normal task. Terrible!

    Needless to say, my father’s <ruby>
    	recounting<rt>narrating; relating</rt>
    </ruby> of this cold-blooded beheading of a man with a sword became deeply etched in my young mind. <u><sup class="pattern">SP7</sup>To put it another way, this heavy weight my father carried—a trauma, in today’s terminology—was handed down, in part, to me, his son.</u> That’s how human connections work, how history works.<sup>㋡</sup> It was an act of transference and ritual. My father hardly said a word about his wartime experiences. It’s unlikely that he wanted to remember this execution or to talk about it. Yet he must have felt a compelling need to relate the story to his son, <ruby>his own 
        flesh and blood<rt>親骨肉</rt>
    </ruby>, even if this meant that it would remain an open wound for both of us.

        面對年幼的至親骨肉，村上父親卻講出了沉重的戰場殺戮。父親戰時的創傷也在幼小的村上腦海裏留下了創傷。寧可承受傷痛，也要傳承和記住歷史。

        留意最後一句，也是句型 7 的一種，同位語用逗號隔開。
