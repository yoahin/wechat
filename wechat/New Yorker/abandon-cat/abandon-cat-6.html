        <span class="cap">T</span>he 20th Infantry Regiment, along with my father’s unit, returned to Japan on August 20, 1939. After a year as a soldier, my father resumed his studies at the Seizan school. At the time, the draft meant two years of military service, but for some reason my father served only one. Perhaps the military took into account the fact that he had been enrolled as a student when he was drafted.
    </p>
    <p>
        After his service, my father continued to enthusiastically write haiku. This one, written in October of 1940, was probably inspired by a good-will visit by the Hitler Youth<sup>❉</sup> to Japan:

        the Hitler Youth

        The <b>Hitler Youth</b> (German: Hitlerjugend [ˈhɪtlɐˌjuːɡn̩t], often abbreviated as <b>HJ</b>) was <u>the youth organisation of the Nazi Party in Germany</u>. Its origins dated back to 1922 and it received the name <i>Hitler-Jugend, Bund deutscher Arbeiterjugend</i> ("Hitler Youth, League of German Worker Youth") in July 1926. From 1933 until 1945, it was the sole official boy's youth organisation in Germany and was partially a paramilitary organisation; it was composed of the Hitler Youth proper for male youths aged 14 to 18, and the German Youngsters in the Hitler Youth (<i>Deutsches Jungvolk in der Hitler Jugend</i> or "DJ", also "DJV") for younger boys aged 10 to 14.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>With the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945, the organisation <i>de facto</i> ceased to exist</u>. On 10 October 1945, the Hitler Youth and its subordinate units <u>were outlawed</u> by the Allied Control Council along with other Nazi Party organisations. Under Section 86 of the Criminal Code of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hitler Youth is an "unconstitutional organisation" <u>and the distribution or public use of its symbols, except for educational or research purposes, is illegal</u>.

        Personally, I really like this haiku, which captures an obscure moment in history in a subtle, unusual way. There’s a striking contrast between the far-off bloody conflict in Europe and the deer (probably the famous deer in Nara). Those Hitler Youth, enjoying a short visit to Japan, may very well have gone on to perish in the bitter winters at the Eastern Front.

            俳句中描寫了人們熱烈歡迎希特勒青年團的盛況。如果 deer 諧音同 dear 就説明日語裏作者也玩了諧音梗。但我沒有查證。

        My father always loved literature and, after he became a teacher, spent much of his time reading. Our house was full of books. This may have influenced me in my teens, when I developed a passion for reading myself. My father graduated with honors from the Seizan school, and, in March, 1941, he entered the literature department at Kyoto Imperial University. It can’t have been easy to pass the entrance exam for a top school like Kyoto Imperial University after undergoing a Buddhist education to be a priest. My mother often told me, “Your father’s very bright.” <u><sup class="pattern">SP15</sup>How bright he really was I have no idea.</u> Frankly, it’s not a question that interests me much. For somebody in my line of work<!-- note -->
        <sup>㋡</sup>, intelligence is less important than a sharp intuition. <ruby>
            Be that as it may<rt>despite that; neverthless</rt>
        </ruby>, the fact remains that my father always had excellent grades in school.

            此外，注意句型 15，在之前的推送中也出現過，在下文中還會出現。日文文法將動詞放到句尾，譯者似乎在刻意地保持這種在英語看來是倒裝的風格，儘管此處也衹算部分倒裝。

        This disappointed my father, who I’m sure compared me to himself at the same age. You were born in this peaceful time, he must have thought. You can study as much as you like, with nothing to get in the way. So why can’t you make more of an effort? I think he wanted me to follow the path he hadn’t been able to take because of the war.
    </p>
    <p>
        But I couldn’t live up to my father’s expectations. I never could <ruby>
            will<rt>motivate</rt>
        </ruby> myself to study the way he wanted me to. I found most classes at school <ruby>
            mind-numbing <rt>very boring</rt>
        </ruby>, the school system overly uniform and repressive. <u><sup class="pattern">SP2</sup>This led my father to feel a chronic dismay, and me to feel a chronic distress (and a certain amount of unconscious anger)</u>. When I <ruby>
            débuted<rt>出道</rt>
        </ruby> as a novelist, at thirty, my father was really pleased, but by that time our relationship had grown distant and cool.
