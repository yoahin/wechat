            原來村上的父親本就出身于信教家庭，那麽他爲何又去當兵參戰了呢？

    <span class="cap">W</span>hen my father was a boy, he was sent to be an apprentice at a temple somewhere in <ruby>
        Nara<rt>奈良市</rt>
    </ruby>. The understanding, <ruby>
        presumably<rt>very likely</rt>
    </ruby>, was that he would be adopted into the Nara priest’s family. However, after his apprenticeship he returned home to Kyoto. This was <ruby>
        ostensibly<rt>on the surface</rt>
    </ruby> because the cold had adversely affected<sup>㋡</sup> his health, but the main reason seems to have been that he couldn’t adjust to the new environment. After returning home, he lived, as before, as his parents’ son. But I get the feeling that the experience remained with him, as a deep emotional scar. I can’t point to any particular evidence of this, but there was something about him that made me feel that way.

    I recall now the expression on my father’s face—surprised at first, then impressed, then relieved—when that cat we had supposedly abandoned beat us home.<sup>㋡</sup>

            村上寫道這裏，忽然想起了父親扔貓未遂時的表情變化。乍看突兀，其實是貓像是一個隱喻，指上一段中從小被送去寄養但隨後又選擇回家的父親。

    I’ve never experienced anything like that. I was brought up—fairly lovingly, I’d say—as the only child in an ordinary family. <u><sup class="pattern">SP11</sup>So I can’t understand, on a practical or an emotional level, what kind of psychic scars may result when a child is abandoned by his parents.</u> I can only imagine it on a superficial level.

    The French director François Truffaut talked about being forced to live apart from his parents when he was young. And for the rest of his life he pursued this theme of abandonment<sup>㋡</sup> in his films. Most people probably have some depressing experience they can’t quite put into words but also can’t forget.

    My father graduated from <ruby>
        Higashiyama Junior High School<rt>京都目黑區立 東山中學</rt>
    </ruby> (equivalent to a high school today) in 1936 and entered the School for Seizan<sup>❉</sup> Studies at eighteen. Students generally received a four-year exemption from military service, but he forgot to take care of some administrative paperwork, and in 1938, when he was twenty, he was drafted<sup>㋡</sup>. It was a procedural error, but once that kind of mistake is made you can’t just apologize your way out of it. Bureaucracies and the military are like that. Protocol has to be followed.

        Seizan (西山) is the name of the branch of Jōdo-shū Buddhism (净土宗) that was founded by Hōnen's (法然) disciple, Shōkū (証空). <u>Shōkū often went by the name Seizan as well</u>, however the name derives from the western mountains of Kyoto where Shōkū often dwelt.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a branch of Jōdo, <u>the central practice is devotion to Amida Buddha (阿彌陀佛), and recitation of the nembutsu (念佛)</u>. Shōkū coined the term <i>shiraki no nembutsu</i>, which refers to a practice where one devotes themselves to intense study of Buddhist literature, and then recites the nembutsu with deep, sincere faith. The idea behind <i>shiraki no nembutsu</i> is to demonstrate that in the age of Mappo (末法時期), people cannot achieve Enlightenment on their own, and so they should rely on the compassion of Amida Buddha.
