        Of course I have a lot of memories of my father. It’s only natural, considering that we lived under the same roof of our not exactly spacious home from the time I was born until I left home at eighteen. And, <ruby>
            as is the case with<rt>just like</rt>
        </ruby> most children and parents, I imagine, some of my memories of my father are happy, some not quite so much. But the memories that remain most vividly in my mind now fall into <ruby>
            neither category<rt>neither happy nor unhappy</rt>
        </ruby>; they involve more ordinary events.

        This one, for instance:
    </p>
    <p>
        When we were living in <ruby>
            Shukugawa<rt>夙川</rt>
        </ruby> (part of <ruby>
            Nishinomiya City<rt>西宮市</rt>
        </ruby>, in <ruby>
            Hyogo Prefecture<rt>兵庫縣</rt>
        </ruby>), one day we went to the beach to get rid of a cat. Not a kitten but an older female cat. <u><sup class="pattern">SP15</sup>Why we needed to get rid of it I can’t recall.</u> The house we lived in was a single-family home with a garden and plenty of room for a cat. Maybe it was a stray we’d taken in that was now pregnant, and my parents felt they couldn’t care for it anymore. My memory isn’t clear on this point. Getting rid of cats back then was a common occurrence, not something that anyone would criticize you for. The idea of <ruby>
            neutering<rt>閹割</rt>
        </ruby> cats never crossed anyone’s mind. I was in one of the lower grades in elementary school at the time, I believe, so it was probably around 1955, or a little later. Near our home were the ruins of a bank building that had been bombed by American planes—one of a few still visible scars of the war.

    My father and I set off that summer afternoon to leave the cat by the shore. He pedalled his bicycle, while I sat on the back holding a box with the cat inside. We rode along the Shukugawa River, arrived at the beach at <ruby>
        Koroen<rt>香枦園</rt>
    </ruby>, set the box down among some trees there, and, without a backward glance, headed home. The beach must have been about two kilometres from our house.
</p>

<p>
    At home, we got off the bike—discussing how we felt sorry for the cat, but what could we do?—and <u><sup class="pattern">SP12+18</sup>when we opened the front door the cat we’d just abandoned was there, greeting us with a friendly meow, its tail standing tall.</u> It had <ruby>
        beaten us home<rt>arrvied home earlier than us</rt>
    </ruby>. <ruby>
        For the life of me<rt>In any way at all</rt>
    </ruby>, I couldn’t figure out how it had done that. We’d been on a bike, after all. My father was stumped as well. The two of us stood there for a while, at a total loss for words. Slowly, my father’s look of blank amazement changed to one of admiration and, finally, to an expression of relief. And the cat went back to being our pet.

    We always had cats at home, and we liked them. I didn’t have any brothers or sisters, and cats and books were my best friends when I was growing up. I loved to sit on the <ruby>
        veranda<rt>游廊、陽臺</rt>
    </ruby> with a cat, sunning myself. So why did we have to take that cat to the beach and abandon it? Why didn’t I protest? These questions—along with that of how the cat beat us home—are still unanswered.

            You can <i>never</i> abandon a cat. You can only lose it when it decides to abandon you!

    Another memory of my father is this:
</p>

<p>
    Every morning, before breakfast, he would sit for a long time in front of the butsudan<sup>❉</sup> shrine in our home, intently reciting Buddhist <ruby>
        sutras<rt>經文</rt>
    </ruby>, with his eyes closed. It wasn’t a regular Buddhist shrine, exactly, but a small cylindrical glass case with a beautifully carved bodhisattva<sup>❉</sup> statue inside. Why did my father recite sutras every morning in front of that glass case, instead of in front of a standard butsudan? That’s one more on my list of unanswered questions.
</p>
<blockquote class="wiki">

        A <b>Butsudan</b>, sometimes spelled Butudan, is a shrine commonly found in temples and homes in Japanese Buddhist cultures.

        In Buddhism, a <b>bodhisattva</b> is any person who is on the path towards Buddhahood. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Early Buddhist schools as well as modern Theravada Buddhism, a bodhisattva refers to anyone who has made a resolution to become a Buddha and has also received a confirmation or prediction from a living Buddha that this will be so.

        At any rate<rt>anyhow</rt>
    </ruby>, this was obviously an important ritual for him, one that marked the start of each day. As far as I know, he never failed to perform what he called his “duty,” and no one was allowed to interfere with it. There was an intense focus about the whole act. <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>Simply labelling it “a daily habit” doesn’t do it justice.</u>

        It is not fair enough to simply label my father's daily duty "a daily habit".

<p>
    Once, when I was a child, I asked him whom he was praying for. And he replied that it was for those who had died in the war. His fellow Japanese soldiers who’d died, as well as the Chinese who’d been their enemy. He didn’t elaborate, and I didn’t <ruby>
        press<rt>追問</rt>
    </ruby> him. I suspect that if I had he would have opened up more. But I didn’t. There must have been something in<sup>㋡</sup> me that prevented me from pursuing the topic.
