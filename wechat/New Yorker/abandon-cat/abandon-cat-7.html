        <span class="cap">M</span>y father graduated from the School for Seizan Studies in the spring of 1941, and at the end of September received a special draft notice. On October 3rd, he was back in uniform, first in the 20th Infantry Regiment (Fukuchiyama), and then in the 53rd Transport Regiment, which was part of the 53rd Division.

            另外，前文中村上提到，父親第一次參軍是 1938 年 8 月。這一年之前的 1937 年，盧溝橋事變、淞滬會戰、南京屠城，日軍在大肆侵略。

    In 1940, the 16th Division had been permanently stationed in <ruby>

    </ruby>, and while it was there the 53rd Division in Kyoto was organized to take its place. Most likely, the confusion of this sudden reorganization accounts for why my father was initially placed in the Fukuchiyama Regiment. (As I said, I was always mistakenly convinced that he’d been in the Fukuchiyama Regiment from the first time he was drafted.) The 53rd Division was sent to <ruby>

    But quite unexpectedly, on November 30, 1941, my father was released from military service<sup>㋡</sup> and allowed to return to civilian life. November 30th was eight days before the attack on Pearl Harbor. After that attack, I doubt that the military would have been generous enough to let him go.

        父親作爲個體算是幸運的，兩次參軍都比較短暫，而且順利脫離了軍隊。正如作者所説，如果父親留到珍珠港戰役之後，怕是凶多吉少了。

        service 意思為兵役時，說 the service, 或者 military service。還有一種説法是 the services，為復數，雖然也是服兵役的意思，但是包含了海陸空三個軍種。

    As my father told it, his life was saved by one officer. My father was a <ruby>
        pfc.<rt>一等兵</rt>
    </ruby><sup>❉</sup> at the time and was summoned by a senior officer, who told him, “You’re studying at Kyoto Imperial University, and would better serve the country by continuing your studies than by being a soldier.” Did one officer have the authority to make this decision? I have no idea. It’s hard to <ruby>
        conceive<rt>imagine</rt>
    </ruby> that a humanities student such as my father could be seen as somehow serving the country by returning to college and his study of haiku. There had to be other factors <ruby>

    </ruby>. Either way, he was released from the Army and was a free man again.

    At least that was the story I heard, or have a memory of hearing, as a child. Unfortunately, it doesn’t accord with the facts. Kyoto Imperial University records indicate that my father enrolled in the literature department in October, 1944. Perhaps my memory is cloudy. Or maybe it was my mother who told me this story, and her memory was faulty. And now there’s no way to verify what’s true and what isn’t.
</p>


<p>
    According to the records, my father entered the literature department of Kyoto Imperial University in October, 1944, and graduated in September, 1947. But I have no idea where he was, or what he was doing, between the ages of twenty-three and twenty-six, the three years after he was released from the military and before he entered Kyoto Imperial University.

    Right after my father was released from service, the Second World War broke out in the Pacific. In the course of the war, the 16th Division and the 53rd Division were essentially wiped out. If my father had not been released, if he’d been shipped off with one of his former units, he would almost certainly have died on the battlefield, and then, of course, I wouldn’t be alive now. You could call it fortunate, but having his own life saved while his former comrades lost theirs became a source of great pain and anguish. I understand <ruby>
        all the more<rt>even more than before</rt>
    </ruby> now why he closed his eyes and devoutly recited the sutras every morning of his life.<sup>㋡</sup>

    In September, 1947, my father passed the exams to receive his B.A. and went on to the graduate program in literature at Kyoto Imperial University. I was born in January, 1949. Because of his age, and the fact that he was married and had a child, my father had to give up his studies before completing the program. In order to make a living, he took a position as a Japanese teacher at Koyo Gakuin, in Nishinomiya. I don’t know the details of how my father and mother came to be married. Since they lived far apart—one in Kyoto, the other in Osaka—most likely a mutual acquaintance had introduced them. My mother had intended to marry another man, a music teacher, but he died in the war. And the store that her father had owned, in Senba, Osaka<sup>㋡</sup>, burned down in a U.S. bombing raid. She always remembered Grumman carrier-based fighters <ruby>
