  The concentration of gains mirrors Bloomberg’s ranking of individual billionaires, where Jeff Bezos is similarly pulling away from the rest.

  These outsized fortunes have sharpened calls for wealth taxes at a time when a pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests have highlighted <ruby>runaway<rt>unchecked</rt></ruby> inequality.

  <p class="wiki-entry">Estate tax in the United States</p>
  <p>
    The estate tax in the United States is a tax on the transfer of the estate of a deceased person. The tax applies to property that is transferred via a will or according to state laws of intestacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>If an asset is left to a spouse or a federally recognized charity, the tax usually does not apply. In addition, a maximum amount, varying year by year, can be given by an individual, before and/or upon their death, without incurring federal gift or estate taxes</u>: $5,340,000 for estates of persons dying in 2014 and 2015, $5,450,000 (effectively $10.90 million per married couple, assuming the deceased spouse did not leave assets to the surviving spouse) for estates of persons dying in 2016. Because of these exemptions, it is estimated that only the largest 0.2% of estates in the U.S. will pay the tax. For 2017, the exemption increased to $5.49 million. In 2018, the exemption doubled to $11.18 million per taxpayer due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. As a result, only about 2,000 estates per year in the US are currently liable for federal estate tax.

  “One of the powerful things about <ruby>intergenerational<rt>passed onto next generations</rt></ruby> wealth is they have very long-term time horizons,” said Karen Harding, who heads up the private-wealth group at Boston-based NEPC, which advises ultra-high-net-worth families. “Most family offices are in a position to accept markets go up and markets go down.”
