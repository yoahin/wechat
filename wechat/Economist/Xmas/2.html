There were multiple excuses for <ruby>merriment over<rt>for the fun of</rt></ruby> Christmas and the new year. Two favourites were the Feast of Fools<sup>❉</sup> on New Year’s Day, when boy <ruby>choristers<rt>唱诗班的男童</rt></ruby> or local mad men were temporarily made into bishops, and the Feast of the Ass<sup>❉</sup> on January 14th, which celebrated the Holy family’s flight into Egypt. Tradition called for a girl carrying a baby to ride a donkey into a church while the congregation chorused “hee-haw” instead of “Amen”. As well as eating and drinking to excess, cross-dressing was widespread during festivities (<u>it was especially popular with priests</u>).

       Over the centuries the authorities tried their best to crack down on Christmas debauchery. In 1445 Charles VII of France issued a decree against priests’ “derisive mockeries and spectacles”. Nearly a century later, in England, Henry VIII outlawed carol singers and the tradition of having “children be <ruby>strangelye<rt>strangely</rt></ruby><sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❸</sup> decked and <ruby>apparelid<rt>apparelled</rt></ruby> to <ruby>couterfaite<rt>counterfeit</rt></ruby> priestes, bysshops and women”.

	 Oliver Cromwell (25 April 1599 – 3 September 1658) was an English general and statesman who led the Parliament of England's armies against King Charles I during the English Civil War and ruled the British Isles as Lord Protector from 1653 until his death in 1658. He acted simultaneously as head of state and head of government of the new republican commonwealth.

      As the Puritans discovered, Christmas is uncancellable. Despite their best efforts, “wilful and strict observation of the day commonly called Christmas” continued: shops closed and people put down their tools “to the great dishonour of Almighty God”. When the Lord Mayor of London and his men went around tearing wreaths and <ruby>mistletoe<rt>槲寄生</rt></ruby> from people’s doors, they were roundly mocked (“Their madnesse hath extended itself to the very vegetables,”<sup style="color: #B48EAD">❻</sup> wrote John Taylor, a Royalist poet). Still, the Puritans stuck to their principles. Christmas remained illegal until the monarchy was restored, under a party-loving king, in 1660.
