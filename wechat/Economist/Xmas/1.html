	The Holly and the Ivy 是英国传统圣诞节颂歌。这首曲子只能溯源至19世纪，这之前人们可能用的别的植物来书写颂歌。

      <p>	由于耶稣的诞生日期无法确定，圣经上也无相关记载，所以在学术上认为圣诞节是以圣母领报（3月25日）的日期来推估，或是在基督教发展初期将古罗马的农神节（罗马多神信仰）转化而来，当时社会上（如古罗马的冬至）以该节日庆祝日照时间由短变长。西方教会在发展初期至4世纪前中期开始将圣诞节定在12月25日，东方正教会稍晚以儒略历定于1月7日，亚美尼亚教会则定在1月6日或1月19日。

      <p>
	"The Holly and the Ivy" is a traditional British folk Christmas carol, listed as number 514 in the Roud Folk Song Index. The song can be traced only as far as the early nineteenth century, but the lyrics reflect an association between holly and Christmas dating at least as far as medieval times.

      <u>The end of December was already Roman party season. Rome was awash with drunken feasting during <ruby>Saturnalia<rt>萨图恩节</rt></ruby>, the most debauched carnival in the calendar</u> (and precursor to the modern Christmas party), which the Emperor Augustus limited to three days, and Caligula extended to five. During this period gambling was allowed in public and people swapped boring white togas for colourful robes. Roman life, normally so hierarchical, was <ruby>turned on its head<rt>be made completely different</rt></ruby>: slaves were served wine by their masters, cross-dressing was encouraged (the pantomime dame<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❸</sup> has ancient roots), and an ordinary man was elected King of the Saturnalia with the power to pass any “law” he fancied, so long as it was suitably hilarious. (Not everyone was out having fun.

      <p>	农神节或萨图尔纳利亚（拉丁语：Saturnalia）是古罗马在年底为祭祀农神的大型节日，一般在每年的12月17日至12月24日间召开。古罗马广场农神庙内有由罗马皇帝主持的隆重的祭祀活动，祭祀罗马农神萨图尔努斯（Saturnus）。一些历史学家认为罗马帝国被基督化后，农神节的许多习俗被转用于圣诞节。例如圣诞树来自于农神节的丰收树。节日期间的活动包括农神庙的兽祭，广场上的大型公共宴会以及欢会，和礼物的馈赠。农神节类似于中国的庙会。
      </p>
      <p>农神龙属（属名：Saturnalia）又名 萨特恩纳利亚龙，是种非常早期的蜥臀目恐龙，化石发现于巴西和津巴布韦，生存于三叠纪后期的卡尼阶，约2亿3300万年前，使它们成为目前所发现最古老的真正恐龙之一。</p>
      <p>	农神龙的正模标本是在1999年冬季时，于巴西南里奥格兰德州发现，<u>另外的化石是在狂欢节期间发现的，而狂欢节起源于古罗马冬至的节庆农神节</u>，因此以古罗马的农神萨图尔努斯为名。
