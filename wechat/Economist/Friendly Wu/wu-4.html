        <span class="cap">J</span>amal moved in with Claiborne in Beijing in January 2012 as she was entering the third year of her third tour. The move increased her concern about being dependent on Mr Wu. Soon after, she had a bad dream. “I really don’t want my neck or your <ruby>neck 
            in a noose<rt>in a dangerour situation</rt>
        </ruby>,” she told Jamal. But her involvement with the <span class="small-cap-style">mss</span> would only deepen with the young man in China.<sup>㋡</sup>

        In February Claiborne looked into whether Jamal could go to <ruby>
            Raffles Design Institute<rt>萊佛士設計學院</rt>
        </ruby> in Shanghai. A three-year degree cost 301,500 yuan ($48,000), she told Jamal, then followed up with another message warning him that she didn’t want to accept any more handouts. “While I want you to go to school to fulfil your dream, I would like for you to enter the school on your own accord,” she wrote. She asked him not to send a “blast email”<sup>㋡</sup> to Mr Wu.

        Jamal was annoyed. “Stop worrying about owing Mr Wu,” he wrote back. He told Claiborne that he intended to use all the connections he had. “It takes support to push through to success.” Then he did exactly the thing that she had asked him not to: he emailed Mr Wu and told <ruby>
            him<rt>Mr Wu</rt>
        </ruby> everything. “One moment she gives you the green light to help me,” <ruby>
            he<rt>Jamal</rt>
        </ruby> complained. “The next moment, she doesn’t want <ruby>

        </ruby> to move forward with helping me.” <ruby>
            He<rt>Jamal</rt>
        </ruby> said that he would do what he liked, no matter what Claiborne said. “I feel as a man that it is important to develop a relationship with <ruby>
            you<rt>Mr Wu</rt>
        </ruby> apart from her because you are extending your hand to help me.”

        The Chinese agent replied that he would try to convince Claiborne. Soon after, according to court filings, he took over the task of enrolling Jamal at Raffles, covering his school fees and getting him settled in Shanghai.

    <p>
        That spring Jamal leaned on Mr Wu more and more. The Chinese operative arranged for him to travel from Beijing to Yiwu, a large city outside Shanghai where vendors <ruby>
            hawk<rt>沿街叫賣</rt>
        </ruby> craft supplies. Jamal then took a trip to Shanghai with two friends, and Mr Wu paid for their tickets. When the young man finally moved from Beijing to start fashion school in Shanghai, Mr Wu found him an apartment, covered the rent and gave him a monthly stipend of 3,000 yuan. Whenever Jamal needed something, he asked Mr Wu: a shaver, a sewing machine, a trip to Thailand.

    <p>
        Jamal grew close enough to Mr Wu to involve him in his birthday celebration, which took place on a <ruby>
            terrace<rt>陽臺</rt>
        </ruby> of a fancy hotel overlooking Shanghai’s Huangpu river. Claiborne flew to Shanghai for the occasion, and they snapped a photo together<sup>㋡</sup>, the city unfolding behind them. A new contact joined for the event: a man named Mr Zhang (another pseudonym), who was one of Mr Wu’s colleagues at the Shanghai branch of the <span class="small-cap-style">mss</span>. Mr Wu had the cover of being a businessman, but his partner gave no pretence of being anything but a spy. It is not unusual for <span class="small-cap-style">mss</span> agents to work in pairs, to prevent graft and ensure that sources actually exist. Mr Zhang quickly became as involved in Claiborne’s and Jamal’s lives as Mr Wu. In a note to Jamal one day, he told the young man not to worry about making money. “You should focus on the school,” he wrote. “Me and Mr Wu will try our best to cover the expenses.”

        While Jamal was burning through money sent by Mr Wu, the <span class="small-cap-style">mss</span> was staging its biggest intelligence coup <ruby>

        </ruby>: penetrating the secret communications system of the <span class="small-cap-style">cia</span>. Beginning in 2010, <span class="small-cap-style">cia</span> sources in China started disappearing or dying <ruby>
            at an alarming clip<rt>considerably quickly</rt>
        </ruby>. In one case, a source who worked for a Chinese government ministry was shot <ruby>

        </ruby> in front of his colleagues.

    Claiborne probably knew nothing of this, but she was growing increasingly <ruby>
        skittish<rt>restive; 焦灼</rt>
    </ruby> about her own situation. In September 2012, shortly after Jamal’s birthday celebration, she told an acquaintance that she was deleting her Facebook account, explaining that the site made it easy for people to collect personal details and other information. As her tour in Beijing drew to a close, court documents show that she lied on a State Department exit-interview<sup>❉</sup> form that asked her to list all interactions she’d had with foreign nationals, writing “none”.

        An <b>exit interview</b> is a survey conducted with an individual who is separating from an organization or relationship. Most commonly, this occurs between an employee and an organization, a student and an educational institution, or a member and an association.  
    </p>
    <p>
        An organization can use the information gained from an exit interview to assess what should be improved, changed, or remain intact. More so, an organization can use the results from exit interviews to reduce employee, student, or member turnover and increase productivity and engagement, thus reducing the high costs associated with turnover.

    Claiborne’s next posting was to <ruby>
        Khartoum<rt>
            喀土穆</rt>
    </ruby> in Sudan. After leaving China, she urged Jamal to take a more responsible attitude to the unearned <ruby>
        largesse<rt>money and treat</rt>
    </ruby> he was enjoying there. “You are there on someone else’s dime…and because of someone else’s sacrifices,” she reminded him. But still she indulged him<sup>㋡</sup>, asking Mr Wu for help sending him on holiday between school terms. “I think it would be good if he could go home for that time…it will do him good,” she wrote to Mr Wu. “Is there some way you can make that happen?”

    As a parting gift, Mr Wu and Mr Zhang gave Claiborne an iPhone and a MacBook, devices that they may have used to track her from halfway around the world.<sup>㋡</sup>

    The emails, text messages and photos obtained by the <span class="small-cap-style">fbi</span> don’t explain everything about Claiborne’s relationship with Mr Wu. One August, when the temperature in Beijing soared to the high 20s, Claiborne emailed him saying that her feet were cold and she needed <ruby>
        slippers<rt>室内穿的便鞋</rt>
    </ruby> – an odd request that suggests she was talking about something other than her feet. The court documents show that the Chinese intelligence officers gave gifts and payments worth tens of thousands of dollars to Claiborne and Jamal, but reveal little about what happened when they met in person. After Claiborne left China <u>
        <span class="u-mark">☈</span>she seemed to <ruby>
            veer<rt>change quickly</rt>
        </ruby> between efforts to
    </u> distance herself from her Chinese contacts and friendly correspondence with them.

<p>
    Mr Wu and Mr Zhang were apparently <ruby>
        unfazed<rt>not affected</rt>
    </ruby> by Claiborne’s move to Khartoum and her attempts to pull away. There is no known example of <span class="small-cap-style">mss</span> operatives ending a relationship. According to court documents, Claiborne had been in Sudan only weeks when she heard, in August 2013, that Jamal had been accused of a crime in China. (A source close to the case called it a “personal indiscretion”.) Mr Zhang offered his assistance. He and Mr Wu had intervened on Jamal’s behalf and convinced the police not to prosecute, he told Claiborne, but the authorities had insisted on cancelling Jamal’s student visa. Jamal had just days to leave the country. Ever obliging, the agents booked the young man a one-way ticket to Washington, <span class="small-cap-style">dc</span>.
</p>

<p>
    If it was all a setup, it was a curious move. The Chinese agents exerted control over Claiborne through Jamal. Once he was out of China, they would have less immediate leverage. On the other hand, the event left Claiborne even more beholden to them. Afterwards, she urged Jamal to cut off communication with Mr Wu and Mr Zhang, saying, “This has been too much for me from the beginning and I want to be free of this.” She added that she didn’t want to be indebted “to anyone but God”. A few months later, Mr Zhang wrote to Claiborne saying that he and Mr Wu were planning a tour of Africa and wanted to stop in Khartoum. She <ruby>
        demurred<rt>disagree and refuse</rt>
    </ruby>. He followed up in March and Mr Wu tried in April: “If everything smooth, we should be in Africa beginning of May,” he wrote. In the response detailed in court filings, Claiborne said that she had taken a new position in Washington, <span class="small-cap-style">dc</span>, then emailed Jamal and warned him not to reveal her actual location. “As far as you know I’m in <span class="small-cap-style">dc</span>,” she wrote.
</p>

<p>
    But Claiborne remained in their orbit. In August she sent them a warm email thanking them for the help they had given Jamal, signing the message “Kangdai”, the Chinese name she had adopted. When she was back in Washington in September 2015, she emailed Mr Wu her bank details, along with a note asking if he could help out. His response made clear that she meant with money. “Can you inform me clearly the 5k to which account?”<sup>㋡</sup>
