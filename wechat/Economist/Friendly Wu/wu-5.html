    A few days after the exchange with Mr Wu about money, the State Department brought Claiborne in for an unexpected security review. The investigator, Patricia Crampton, started the encounter with a warning: “18 <span class="small-cap-style">usc</span> 1001 makes it a crime to knowingly falsify or conceal material facts related to this investigation.” Crampton went on to ask for a detailed explanation of Claiborne’s activities in China. In her response, according to the court filings, Claiborne lied about her contacts there, the gifts she had received and the extent of Jamal’s overseas travels.

    After the interview, she panicked. She called Jamal from a phone booth three floors beneath her office in the State Department and urged him not to “say anything about…um…ya know”. She also called Mr Wu and told him that she’d been brought in for review, warning him not to transfer the money. “They ask oh so many questions,” she told him. “You have no idea.”
</p>
<p>
    “So I can’t transfer the 5k to your that – to your account?” Mr Wu asked.
</p>

<p>
    “No no no no no,”<sup>㋡</sup> she said, <u><sup class="pattern">SP18</sup>her voice crackling through the pay phone.</u> “No no no no no.” Later she added: “I just cleaned, cleaned up all my emails and stuff. You know, delete, delete, delete.”

    “Good,” Mr Wu said. “Understand.”
</p>

<p>
    Crampton knew Claiborne had made false statements, but investigators sat on the case for months hoping to catch her committing a more serious crime. Now that Claiborne was stationed in America, the <span class="small-cap-style">fbi</span> could easily watch her. Investigators installed surveillance cameras outside her home and at her office at the State Department, and they collected evidence using<sup>㋡</sup> a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant, which allows for covert “sneak-and-peek” searches and tapping of phones. In February 2016 the State Department told Claiborne that her background check was complete, then waited to see what she would do.

    Claiborne became less cautious. When Mr Wu turned 50 that spring, she reminded Jamal to congratulate him. Jamal, meanwhile, planned another trip to China, <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>undeterred by the circumstances under which he had left the country.</u>

        Jamal was not fear of the event last time he encountered in China; it was that event that forced him to leave China then.

    As his plane sat on the runway waiting to take off, he spoke to Claiborne by phone. “If you happen to talk to Mr Wu or any of them, just say <ruby>
        Candace<rt>女主人公的名</rt>
    </ruby> is working in <span class="small-cap-style">dc</span>,” she told him. She added, in a statement which prosecutors would later cite, “I’m sure they’ll ask. They’re spies.”
