        <span class="cap">C</span>laiborne grew up in Maryland, in a loving African-American family, the youngest of seven children. When she eventually <ruby>
            relinquished<rt>unwillingly give up</rt>
        </ruby> her childhood dream of becoming a ballerina, she turned in a different direction: she married a <ruby>
            devout<rt>very devoted</rt>
        </ruby> Muslim, converted to Islam and had four children. Friends know little about this period of her life. One said that Claiborne settled with her then-husband in New York state in a community of members of the Nation of Islam, an African-American religious organisation.
    </p>
<p>
    When the marriage ended some years later, her exit was hurried and undignified<sup>㋡</sup>. She stuffed her belongings into bin bags and moved to Baltimore. “She called our parents and asked if she could come home to start her life over,” her brother Kevin wrote in a letter to the court. From a world of <ruby>
        tutus and pointe shoes<rt>芭蕾舞裙和芭蕾硬尖鞋</rt>
    </ruby>, he said, she would “begin reconstructing a life with no appreciable job skills, no work experience, no professional education”.

    The family home was <ruby>
        sparse<rt>家裏擺設少</rt>
    </ruby> but orderly and stable. “There was very little comfortable furniture but there was a long study table and a computer for use by the children,” a former <span class="small-cap-style">us</span> civil servant who mentored one of her sons wrote in a letter to the court. Ensuring a good education for her children became Claiborne’s new dream, according to her brother, and she pursued it with the same dedication she had shown as a ballet dancer, scouring the internet for cheap or free online courses. But sending her children to college would require real money. Her first shot at getting it came in 1999, with a steady job at the State Department.<sup>㋡</sup>

    The State Department has a famously competitive entry process for foreign-service officers. Administrative jobs are less prestigious but dependable. Staff change posts every two to three years – housing and travel allowances make the frequent moves worthwhile. To boost her salary and save up for her children’s education, Claiborne volunteered for hardship postings: jobs in countries where conditions were tough, <ruby>
        that<rt>jobs</rt>
    </ruby> pay an additional 15-35%. Typically, employees do one or two before requesting less arduous locations. Claiborne would go on to do five in a row, including <ruby>

At some point during these tours she met Mr Wu, who spoke good English, and by 2007 they were in regular email contact.

    There is no evidence<sup>㋡</sup> in the court papers that Mr Wu asked Claiborne for anything during the early years of their friendship. But if she ever thought that he was merely a benevolent businessman, it would have been clear to her by 2011 that there was more to the story.<sup>㋡</sup> According to the court papers, in April of that year, Claiborne received a transfer for $2,480 from a Hong Kong company called Delta Shipping Co Ltd, along with a note saying the money was for Jamal. She didn’t report it. The following month, Chinese officials flew to America to meet Joe Biden, the vice-president, and Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, for the <span class="small-cap-style">us</span>-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, a series of high-level meetings between the two countries. After the summit, Mr Wu asked Claiborne for the State Department’s internal assessment of the dialogue. In particular, he wanted to know what the United States might do if China didn’t stick to the agreed timetable for revaluing the yuan.

    Claiborne sent him a response with general information, some apparently drawn from public sources. “Was the stuff I sent useful?” she later asked Mr Wu by email.
</p>

<p>
    “It is useful but it is also on the internet,” he responded dryly. “What they are looking for is what they cannot find on the internet.”
</p>
<p>
    This was a crucial turning point,<sup>㋡</sup> said Robert David Booth, a former deputy-director of counterintelligence for the State Department and author of “State Department Counterintelligence: Leaks, Spies, and Lies”. “The light had to go on,” he said. “I don’t care how naive she was and what she was trying to do. She finally had to stop deluding herself.”<sup>㋡</sup>

    </ruby>. “To tell you the truth, I really don’t want to spend time on this kind of stuff,” she wrote. “I’m sorry, I don’t have the time or the energy.”
