        <span class="cap">M</span>r Wu had plenty of time to devote to the relationship, however. He was what intelligence experts call a “cutout”<sup>㋡</sup> an operative with a credible cover working for China’s Ministry of State Security (<span class="small-cap-style">mss</span>).

    During the cold war, Western spies fretted over the ingenuity and ruthlessness of their <span class="small-cap-style">kgb</span> adversaries, but tended to downplay China’s intelligence capabilities. If there was a threat, it was said to come from the sheer number of people, primarily ethnic Chinese, that the Chinese Communist Party could harness to work in intelligence operations – what was called a “thousand grains of sand”<sup>㋡</sup> or “vacuum cleaner”<sup>㋡</sup> approach to spying. <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>This revealed <ruby>
        as much<rt>the same</rt>
    </ruby> about Western assumptions and prejudices as it did about China’s tactics.</u> In truth, Chinese intelligence services have long used approaches both creative and classic to turn agents or <ruby>

    A pivotal case came in 2003, when a Japanese code clerk in Japan’s Shanghai <ruby>
        consulate<rt>領事館</rt>
    </ruby> had an affair with a local woman who worked at a karaoke bar. The Shanghai branch of the (<span class="small-cap-style">mss</span>) used the relationship to push the man into giving up personal information on his colleagues, as well as the schedule for taking diplomatic pouches<sup>❉</sup> to Tokyo. The <ruby>

    <p>
        A diplomatic bag, also known as <b>a diplomatic pouch</b>, is <u>a container with certain legal protections used for carrying official correspondence or other items between a diplomatic mission and its home government</u> or other diplomatic, consular, or otherwise official entity. The physical concept of a "diplomatic bag" is flexible and therefore can take many forms (e.g., a cardboard box, briefcase, duffel bag, large suitcase, crate or even a shipping container).

    In 2004 the Shanghai branch of the (<span class="small-cap-style">mss</span>) recruited an American graduate, Glenn Duffie Shriver, using a novel <ruby>
        ruse<rt>trick</rt>
    </ruby>: a call for essays on <span class="small-cap-style">us</span>-China relations. Officers told Shriver, who was living in Shanghai, that he’d written the winning essay. They then groomed him to join the State Department, paying him $70,000 for his loyalty. Shriver flunked the foreign-service exam, and by the time he applied to the <span class="small-cap-style">cia</span>, American operatives were <ruby>        on to<rt>investigating</rt>
    </ruby> him. But the incident alarmed the overseas intelligence community because of the sheer time and resources China’s spy services were willing to commit to a single asset who might not even end up doing a useful job. “The (<span class="small-cap-style">mss</span>) is as patient and good as any service I’ve ever dealt with,” said Booth.

    And so it was with Claiborne.<sup>㋡</sup> Mr Wu, who also worked for the Shanghai branch of the (<span class="small-cap-style">mss</span>), pushed Claiborne only lightly when she dodged his requests for inside information. Perhaps he calculated that her concerns about Jamal would send her calling again soon. Two months after saying she didn’t have time to help, Claiborne had lunch with Mr Wu. Two days later, she sent what seems to have been a follow-up request for funds.
