    <p>
        <span class="cap">I</span>n a cold, dark evening in January 2017, several days after the inauguration of Donald Trump as president, a man stood outside Claiborne’s door as she returned home from work. He introduced himself as a colleague of Mr Wu and Mr Zhang, and Claiborne ushered him inside.
    </p>

<p>
    The man, who was <ruby>
        ethnically Chinese<rt>華裔</rt>
    </ruby>, explained that he worked for the <span class="small-cap-style">mss</span>. When he offered Claiborne a chunk of cash, she refused. “Things are not the way they used to be,” she warned him. The Feds were asking too many questions, she added. She seemed unconcerned by his claim that he worked for the <span class="small-cap-style">mss</span>, and when he told Claiborne that she was one of the state security ministry’s “highest regarded” friends, she didn’t correct him. In fact, Claiborne’s visitor was an <span class="small-cap-style">fbi</span> agent working undercover. Soon after, Claiborne was arrested at home. Jamal was named as co-conspirator, but never charged with any wrongdoing.
</p>

<p>
    In April 2019 Claiborne pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the United States. Her sentencing was held in Washington’s E. Barrett Prettyman Building, the same courthouse where the warrant authorising her surveillance had been issued. In a courtroom decked out with blond wood and a green carpet, before a small audience of investigators, relatives and bystanders, Judge Randolph Moss considered her situation.<sup>㋡</sup>

        這種庭審應該是不公開的，small audience 便是證明。庭審的細節描寫很有必要，增加了真實感，下同。

    Prosecutors argued that she had passed sensitive information to the <span class="small-cap-style">mss</span>, and that her actions could have damaged State Department operations, noting that the devices she accepted might have <ruby>

    </ruby> bugs. Claiborne’s lawyer, a public defender, stumbled. “She made a mistake that then turned into criminal conduct,” he said weakly.

    She sat to one side of him, wearing an orange jumpsuit and a headscarf. In the time since her arrest, she had turned back to religion – she now prayed five times a day – and her dancer’s poise had degenerated into a slump.<sup>㋡</sup> When the lawyers finished, she slid on a pair of reading glasses and read from a prepared statement. “This is not what I envisioned for my life – to be looked down upon, to be sentenced as a criminal,” Claiborne said. “To this day I still don’t know how I lost myself.” She continued: “I weep into my soul. I do not know how I lost my moral compass.” Her voice cracked.

    The judge sentenced her to 40 months in prison and a $40,000 fine.
</p>

<p>
    Absent from the courtroom were Mr Wu and Mr Zhang, who presumably continued their work back in China. But at the very back of the <ruby>
        gallery<rt>旁聽席</rt>
    </ruby>, a few rows behind a cluster of Claiborne’s family members, sat a young man who <ruby>
        resembled<rt>looked like</rt>
    </ruby> the photos available online for Jamal. By the time the judge adjourned the court and the observers filed out, he was gone.<span style="color: #ad0600; font-size: 18pt;">●</span>

        Jamal 可能在庭審現場的角落裏聽完了庭審，然後悄悄離開了。現在他對 MSS 已經毫無用處了，自然也不會收到任何資金和支援了。

        諜戰也是用兵，交戰雙方互有勝負，兵家常事。這是一個美奸的故事。
