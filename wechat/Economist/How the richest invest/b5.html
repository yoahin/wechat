      Not everyone thinks their growing influence is benign, however. Brooke Harrington of Copenhagen Business School worries that the growth of <small>fos</small> is undermining <ruby>meritocracy<rt>精英统治</rt></ruby> in capitalism. “The bigger the apparatus they have behind them, the harder it is for the market to discipline them,” she says. Chuck Collins of the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, in Washington, <small>dc</small>, <ruby>frets<rt>worry</rt></ruby> over opacity—“they ensure ever more wealth goes off the <ruby>ledger<rt>账本</rt></ruby>”—and their growing lobbying <ruby>clout<rt>influence</rt></ruby>. He argues that <u>billionaires and their <small>fos</small> have worked tirelessly to <ruby>exploit loopholes<rt>钻空子</rt></ruby> and rig rules to further their interests, most notably by helping to gut America’s estate tax</u>. “They are in the dynasty-protection business, trying to arrest the normal, natural process of wealth dispersal,” he says.

      <small>fos</small> are nonetheless in expansion mode, opening satellite offices on other continents.

The rush to Asia is partly about locating closer to investment opportunities and partly, for <small>mfos</small>, about proximity to a fast-growing pool of potential new clients.

      China alone produced two new billionaires a week in 2017. Rich Asians had preferred to keep their money in the businesses they created, reinvesting to build conglomerates. The new generation, having made much of its money in technology and services, is more comfortable cashing out, trading assets and transferring <ruby>a slab of<rt>一大笔</rt></ruby> their wealth to an investment office. In the past ten years the number of Asia-based <small>fos</small> has climbed from around 50 to somewhere between 500 and 1,000.

      This increased willingness to release cash from the primary family business and invest it elsewhere, combined with the rise of the do-it-yourself approach to managing wealth, suggests that the number of <small>fos</small> will <ruby>go on<rt>continue</rt></ruby> rising.
