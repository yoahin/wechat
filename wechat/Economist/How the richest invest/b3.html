      This diversity means that <small>fos</small> vary in size. The average one oversees $500m-1bn. The biggest, mostly <small>sfos</small>, administer far more. George Soros’s manages $25bn. Other giants include Pritzker Group, run by <ruby>scions<rt>名门望族的子弟</rt></ruby> of the family behind the <ruby>Hyatt hotel<rt>凱悅酒店</rt></ruby> chain, and <small>jab</small>, owned by Germany’s Reimann family, whose holdings include <ruby>Keurig Dr Pepper<rt>胡椒博士</rt></ruby> and other food and drink brands—though both prefer to see themselves as diversified investment firms and eschew the <small>fo</small> tag. The very biggest have hundreds of employees and engage in a dizzying array of activities besides managing money (or selecting outside managers to do so). This can include tax and legal services, compliance, cyber-security and monitoring invoices<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup> (yacht firms are notorious for overcharging if they think bills will not face close scrutiny).<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup>

     Some also offer more personal “concierge” services, such as arranging travel (<ruby>down to<rt>even including</rt></ruby> ensuring <ruby>limos<rt>豪华轿车</rt></ruby> are stocked with the right drinks), help with sensitive family issues, such as navigating marriage (<ruby>pre-nups<rt>婚前协定</rt></ruby>) or divorce, or preparing the next generation to take over. Some also help with the family’s philanthropy, though most billionaires have separate charitable foundations to co-ordinate their giving.

      At the top end of the industry, the aim is to offer the families whatever they need, whenever they need it, says Giuseppe Ciucci, Stonehage Fleming’s boss. The role of the <small>fo</small> has evolved into being a trusted adviser on anything from an investment <ruby>conundrum<rt>difficult problem</rt></ruby> to a child going off the rails. Peter York, a British cultural critic, has described <small>fos</small> as “super-help…for the super-rich”.

      These financial butlers are not stuck in the past, however. For some <small>fos</small>, preserving wealth matters more than growing it. When David Tice, an American investor, told the conference in Dubai <u>“you guys are already wealthy and you only need to get wealthy once”, there was much nodding of heads.</u> But many are comfortable at the cutting edge of finance. The <small>fos</small> of the Pritzkers and Bill Gates, for instance, have reportedly been keen buyers of the riskiest “equity” <ruby>tranches<rt>parts</rt></ruby> of collateralised loan obligations (a form of securitised debt).

      <small>fos</small> are also embracing sectors as diverse as cannabis, e-sports and crypto-investing. Of the workshops in Dubai, the biggest <ruby>draw<rt>interest</rt></ruby> was one on blockchain startups and smart contracts. Some are unafraid to swim against the tide.

Flexibility over controversial investments is possible because in many cases <small>fos</small> answer neither to external investors nor regulators. <u>In America, for instance, those managing money only for families or associates are exempt from disclosure and other rules governing investment advisers</u>.

      Open-minded investors with large sums of money have helped to shake up the world of corporate buy-outs
      <sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup>, as <small>fos</small> develop a taste for <ruby>swooping<rt>raid</rt></ruby> on large stakes or entire companies. Private equity’s share of <small>fos</small>’ portfolios has risen steadily. It now accounts for over a fifth of the average one—second only to equities (see chart 3). The $100bn of deals done in 2016 was four times the amount invested in 2011, according to PitchBook, a research firm. Earlier this year Bloomberg called this burst of buying the “rich-ification of private equity”. Another recent report by Campden concluded that <small>fos</small>’ allocations to private equity—including both direct investments and those through funds—could rise by three-quarters between 2017 and 2019.

      Such is the power of family wealth on Wall Street that some mergers-and-acquisitions <ruby>rainmakers<rt>person who grows business</rt></ruby> are building businesses around it. Byron Trott, a former Goldman Sachs partner, is one such <ruby>facilitator<rt>rainmaker</rt></ruby>, bringing <small>fos</small> <ruby>juicy<rt>profitable</rt></ruby> deals, advising on investments and co-investing through his own vehicle, <small>bdt</small> Capital Partners. He worked on <small>jab</small>’s $19bn purchase of Dr Pepper Snapple and is said to be close to the Pritzkers and the Waltons, the family behind Walmart. He is reportedly raising a new fund of up to $9bn to channel family wealth.
