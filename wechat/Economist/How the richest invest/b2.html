      This <ruby>spurt<rt>sudden increase</rt></ruby> reflects an acceleration in the number of billionaires worldwide (see chart 2) and the wealth they control, now estimated at close to $9trn. No one knows how much of that sits in <small>fos</small>, but a reasonable guess is $3trn-4trn. Several factors explain the growth. One is an increase in “liquidity events”: founders or their heirs cashing out of operating businesses, for instance through initial public offerings<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup>, and generating pools of cash that need managing. Another is fashion: <ruby>newly minted<rt>made/created only recently</rt></ruby> billionaires, from Asia in particular, feel increasingly that they are not full members of the club without one<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup>. A third factor, says Philip Marcovici, a wealth-management consultant, is disillusionment with third-party money managers, fuelled by scandals over opaque and abusive fees, and banks pushing their own expensive products, or <ruby>those<rt>expensive products</rt></ruby> of partners, in return for <ruby>kickbacks<rt>回扣</rt></ruby>. “The feeling is that if you want the job done well, you have to take it in-house.”

      <p>IPO 圈一波钱，然后拿钱离场，潇洒。</p>
      <p>...“without one.” = without such a family office. 这些新贵们感觉如果没有自己 FO 就不算是超级富豪行列里的一员了。FO 已经开始成为一种富豪群体的风气，一种群体标识。</p>
      <p>第三点很有意思，富豪们觉得把钱交给投行或者第三方资管机构是下策，这些机构操作不透明，收费过高，丑闻频出。富人精明啊，穷人都是直接买理财或者 P2P，最后遭遇暴雷，财富缩水或被洗劫。富豪则宁可麻烦也要拥有自己的资管机构。正如菲茨杰拉德所言：富人和你我不一样。</p>

    <p class="te-p">“Multi-family offices” (<small>mfos</small>), by contrast, serve more than one master. Most manage the affairs of a handful of families. The largest serve hundreds. Pooling costs makes them viable for clans with as little as $25m. Some <small>mfos</small> began as <small>sfos</small>, branching out later in the search for growth. Others were established as multi-client businesses by third-party money managers. Mergers have created hybrids. London-based Stonehage Fleming<sup>❉</sup> was formed in 2014 when the office of Britain’s Fleming family (relatives of Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond) merged with a <ruby>fiduciary<rt>信托</rt></ruby> firm serving South African families that had fled the apartheid regime. It has some 250 families on its books.</p>

      Some <small>mfos</small> act as a family’s sole <small>fo</small>, others as adjuncts. Sandaire, another London-based <small>mfo</small>, whose origins lie in the sale of Provincial, a British insurer, manages money for the former owners, the Scotts, and 31 other families.
