      A long tail<sup>❉</sup> of smaller <small>fos</small> are eager participants in more modest deals. One such is Conexión Capital, whose founding capital came from the sale of Panamco, a Latin American drinks bottler set up by Albert Staton. It focuses on early-stage investments of $1m-10m in consumer-goods firms<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup> with novel products, and looks to stay with them for at least ten years. It recently invested in a firm promising a <ruby>creamier<rt>含脂更丰富的</rt></ruby> sort of <ruby>almond<rt>杏仁</rt></ruby> milk, made by rehydrating crushed-almond <ruby>paste<rt>面团</rt></ruby>. “<ruby>Baristas<rt>咖啡厅服务生</rt></ruby> love it,” says Eduardo Arboleda Staton, the head of Conexión, and Staton’s grandson. Conexión also serves as a kind of merchant bank for <small>fos</small>, bringing other families, particularly from Latin America, into club deals—40-50 are now in the network. “There has been a big <ruby>swing<rt>change/trend</rt></ruby> away from families being just a passive source of capital,”<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❷</sup> says Mr Arboleda Staton.

	长尾（英语：The Long Tail），或译长尾效应，最初由《连线》的总编辑克里斯·安德森（Chris Anderson）于2004年发表于自家的杂志中，用来描述诸如亚马逊公司、Netflix和Real.com/Rhapsody之类的网站之商业和经济模式。是指那些原来不受到重视的销量小但种类多的产品或服务由于总量巨大，累积起来的总收益超过主流产品的现象。在互联网领域，长尾效应尤为显著。长尾这一术语也在统计学中被使用，通常应用在财产的分布和词汇。

	A boutique investment bank is a investment bank that specializes in at least one aspect of investment banking, generally corporate finance, although some banks are retail in nature, such as Charles Schwab or Allen & Co. Of those involved in corporate finance, <u>capital raising, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring and reorganizations are their primary activities</u>.

      Another way to bind the generations together is to accommodate younger family members’ priorities.

Mr Marcovici says<sup style="color: #B48EAD">㋡</sup> <small>fos</small> are more interested in this type of investing than the typical wealth manager, in part because they see it as a good way to draw in millennial heirs with a social conscience.
