    The most important thing to understand about tear gas is that it is not a gas.<sup>㋡</sup> It is a substance, a sort of powder, delivered in the form of smoke from a burning tear gas shell. That powder is 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile<sup>❉</sup> — known as ‘CS’ — a compound developed and tested at the United Kingdom’s notorious Porton Down military facility. As the tear gas canister burns, which it does for around one minute, it spreads smoke containing tiny particles of CS that spread and stick: to clothes, to skin, to surfaces.

     一般客觀描寫時，作者是抽離的、是隱形的，讀者衹能看到作者看到的。但是此處作者跳了出來，指出理解催淚瓦斯的關鍵在於，它并不是一種氣體。

    <p>
        本段寫 CS 氣體的本質、由來。

        The compound <b>2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile</b> (邻-氯代苯亚甲基丙二腈) (chemical formula: C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CIN<sub>2</sub>), a cyanocarbon, is the defining component of tear gas commonly referred to as CS gas, which is used as a riot control agent.

        <u>Exposure causes a burning sensation and tearing of the eyes to the extent that the subject cannot keep his or her eyes open, and a burning irritation of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat</u>, resulting in profuse coughing, nasal mucus discharge, disorientation, and difficulty breathing, partially incapacitating the subject. 
    </p>
    <p class="wiki-entry">Porton Down</p>
    <p>
        <b>Porton Down</b> is a science park in Wiltshire, England, just northeast of the village of Porton, near Salisbury. It is home to two British government facilities: a site of the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) – <u>known for over 100 years as one of the UK's most secretive and controversial military research facilities</u>.

    If you get caught in a cloud of tear gas, the first thing you feel is a stinging in your eyes — a feeling akin to handling raw chilli peppers and then touching your “You will <ruby>
        reflexively<rt>as a response</rt>
    </ruby> close your eyes as they begin to stream with tears. Next, you will feel the burning in your nose and throat. You will choke and cough as the tear gas attacks your <ruby>
        mucous membranes<rt>黏膜</rt>
    </ruby>, and you will be gripped with the sense that you cannot breathe. At the same time, you will feel your skin prickling like a bad case of sunburn. Finally, if you are unlucky enough to get <ruby>
        a real lungful<rt>a large amount of the gas</rt>
    </ruby>, you will be overcome with nausea; you will start to gag and spit, perhaps vomit.<sup>㋡</sup> But most important, from the deployers’ point of view, will be your psychological reaction to tear gas.<sup>㋡</sup> Tear gas obliterates the solidarity of the crowd. When you are hit with tear gas, no longer are you a member of a group gathered together with a common purpose. <u>You are alone, your mind blank, all prior thoughts replaced with only one: the need to get away. Eyes closed, coughing, choking, blinded, and stumbling, you will run.</u>

     本段前半部分細緻描寫了被催淚瓦斯擊中的感受，調用了各種感官（不止是眼睛）來描寫，讀來猶如親身體會。

    <p>
        中閒一句將本段一份為二，後半部側重寫催淚瓦斯的另一個作用：打壓士氣。

    As well as having a psychological effect on those being gassed, tear gas also has a psychological effect on those deploying it and those looking on<sup>㋡</sup>, either in person or through the media. By creating a scene of violence and chaos, tear gas works to objectify the crowd, turning it from a group of human beings into a <ruby>
        seething<rt>quickly moving</rt>
    </ruby>, <ruby>
        writhing<rt>body-twisting</rt>
    </ruby> mass. Tear gas also helps “to turn a protest into a riot — and therefore makes it a legitimate target for further state violence.

     作者再次跳出來，帶讀者進一步、多角度觀察催淚瓦斯在心靈層面的效果。
    </p>

     一般客觀描寫時，作者是隱形的。但主觀描寫時，作者會選有選擇地描寫一些細節，傳遞作者想要傳達的情緒、感覺等。
    </p>
    <p>
      識別並模仿優秀的細節描寫，是不錯的寫作練習。
