<p class="fa-section">THE BIOMEDICAL DATA HUNT</p>
<p>
    Containing infectious diseases can require governments to collect and share personal and population data on a vast scale. This pandemic is no exception. It has intensified trends that were already <ruby>gathering momentum<rt>becoming stronger and stronger</rt></ruby> in the United States and globally. Technology that tracks people’s movements and assesses their health was commonplace before the novel coronavirus <ruby>appeared on the global radar.<rt>appeared and got noticed globally</rt></ruby> Governments and corporations were already intrigued by the potential value of medical data. And the public was increasingly <ruby>poised<rt>ready</rt></ruby> to accept measures that were not long ago seen as invasive.
</p>

<p>
    Surveillance capabilities that were previously used to fight crime and terrorism are now repurposed to fight disease. This repurposing is neither a big organizational nor an especially demanding technological shift. In many countries, biosurveillance has long been included in the portfolio of intelligence agencies. In the United States, the Pentagon and organizations such as DARPA<sup>❉</sup> and the CIA run programs focused on natural and manmade <ruby>pathogens<rt>病原體</rt></ruby>. In Israel, the government recently disclosed the existence<sup>[1]</sup> of a large <ruby>cache<rt>store</rt></ruby> of cellphone data that was originally intended for counterterrorism operations but could be adapted to track the movements and social contacts of infected persons. In South Korea, authorities have used information about credit card transactions<sup>[2]</sup> that is usually collected to combat financial fraud to implement a similar contact-tracing strategy. And in China, the government’s ability to access a vast trove of CCTV footage<sup>[3]</sup> has allowed authorities to retrace interactions among disease carriers at a microsocial level.

    At the same time, new biosurveillance capabilities are in rapid development. They are meant to identify infectious disease carriers and track their social interactions. In Singapore and Taiwan, cellphone apps and scannable QR codes in public places have allowed authorities to monitor the movement of newly arrived visitors <ruby>in the wake of<rt>immediately after and due to</rt></ruby> the COVID-19 outbreak. Dozens of cities in China now use the Alipay Health Code system<sup>[4]</sup> (developed by a subsidiary of the e-commerce giant Alibaba), which automatically assigns each user a color-coded infectious threat level, on the basis of which local authorities can make decisions about mandatory quarantine. In Italy, cellphone providers have made location data accessible to state agencies, which now use the information to determine whether local residents are obeying strict quarantine orders in the Lombardy region. And in the United States, the White House has begun talks with the private sector about tracking people’s locations and linking that information to medical data<sup>[5]</sup>. The proliferation of smartphones and wearable technology—which often records basic biomedical information in real time—has only increased the potential scope of these efforts. Analyzing location data from cellphone towers is the low-hanging fruit rather than the feasible limit.

    But the pandemic is not only fueling the deployment and development of surveillance technology. It is also changing how biomedical data are <ruby>factored into<rt>included as part of</rt></ruby> routine government screening and monitoring. Many travelers are already familiar with thermal scanning at international airports, which allows agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration to identify passengers with fevers before they cross the border. Studies and epidemiological simulations have shown that thermal scanning is unlikely to contain the spread of COVID-19<sup>[6]</sup>, yet demand for such scanners has increased significantly<sup>[7]</sup>. In the wake of the pandemic, travelers, immigrants, and asylum seekers at U.S. borders will likely submit to more such screening, along with medical history questionnaires. So might homeless people and welfare recipients within the United States.

    Government agencies aren’t alone in recognizing the value of personal biomedical data. Corporations see profit in such information, and private organizations may increasingly factor it into their decision-making. In the United Kingdom, several landlords<sup>[8]</sup>, including the McDonald’s charitable foundation, have started to <ruby>evict tenants<rt>force them to leave</rt></ruby> who recently had contact with COVID-19 patients. In the United States, Google’s Project Nightingale<sup>[9]</sup> was recently disclosed to have gathered and analyzed health data from millions of patients in 21 states. Other tech companies, too, are chasing this largely untapped resource. While the collection of medical data remains highly regulated, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to result in policy changes<sup>[10]</sup> that allow private companies more easily to analyze health-related information. Already, the Global Privacy Assembly has identified regulatory changes related to data privacy in 31 countries in response to the pandemic. That trend will likely accelerate.

    Public attitudes toward privacy will partly determine the scope of these developments. At the moment, those attitudes are<ruby> in flux<rt>continuously changing</rt></ruby>. Such is often the case in a crisis, as the historian Sarah Igo has documented in her book <i>The Known Citizen</i>. The U.S. government first introduced Social Security numbers in the wake of the Great Depression, and at that time, the numbers were widely circulated and even broadcast on local radio stations. <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>The numbers evolved into closely guarded personal identifiers only when concerns about government overreach <ruby>eclipsed<rt>make less important</rt></ruby> the <ruby>preoccupation<rt>obsession</rt></ruby> with access to welfare services and economic relief.</u> The privacy of medical data has changed in similar <ruby>fashion<rt>way</rt></ruby>. When U.S. Boards of Health first mandated the reporting of infectious disease outbreaks in the late nineteenth century, local physicians and newspapers rebelled against a perceived <ruby>affront<rt>offend</rt></ruby> to patients’ privacy and doctors’ professional autonomy. Only later did the routine reporting of vital statistics and infectious diseases become socially accepted and widely practiced. In these cases. the broad public reassessed its standard of privacy <ruby>following<rt>after</rt></rt></ruby> a crisis or a change in state practice. The same dynamic is likely to <ruby>hold<rt>remian unchanged</rt></rt></ruby> today.

        The [Social Security] numbers were not closely protected until when more and more people began to worry that the goverment may go too far (overreach) with their numbers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At that moment, people also no longer thought their numbers were less important than their access to welfare services and economic relief.
