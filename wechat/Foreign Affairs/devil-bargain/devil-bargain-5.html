    <p>
        Americans need not dismiss expert medical advice in order to defend the right to privacy, nor should they surrender the insistence on basic civil rights in a time of crisis. Nonetheless, <ruby>
            the imperative today<rt>當務之急</rt>
        </ruby>  is to guard against misuse, <ruby>
            mission creep<sup>❉</sup><rt>任務蠕變</rt>
        </ruby>, and negative downstream effects—especially given that the luxury of time is not one the country can afford.

            <b>Mission creep</b> is the gradual or incremental expansion of an intervention, project or mission, beyond its original scope, focus or goals, a ratchet effect spawned by initial success. <span style="border-bottom: 1pt solid #4C566A;">Mission creep is usually considered undesirable</span> due to how each success breeds more ambitious interventions until a final failure happens, stopping the intervention entirely.

            The term was originally applied exclusively to military operations, but has recently been applied to many different fields. The phrase first appeared in 1993, in articles published in the Washington Post and in the New York Times concerning the United Nations peacekeeping mission during the Somali Civil War.

        So which steps can be taken now in order to prevent missteps in the future? Emergency legislation should clearly list the powers it unlocks and the conditions that void those powers. Both national security and public health rely on surveillance. But while national security powers are often veiled in secrecy, the same logic doesn’t apply to most biosurveillance campaigns. These must be backed by legislation that clearly articulates and explicitly authorizes them, such that political leaders cannot assume that any practices not forbidden by the Constitution or <ruby>
            judicial precedent<rt>司法判例</rt>
        </ruby> are likely to <ruby>
            pass muster<rt>be acceptable or good enough</rt>
        </ruby>. <u><sup class="pattern">SP16a</sup>The choice, then, is not between assertive emergency responses and personal privacy but between legislative blank checks and robust 
        checks and balances.</u> <ruby>
            By the same toke<rt>In the samilar way</rt>
        </ruby>n, legislators should promote the least invasive solutions available. Scaling up testing for COVID-19, for example, would allow local authorities to target their contact-tracing and quarantine measures—rather than resorting to a dragnet approach that collects everyone’s movement data.

        Americans should <ruby>
            press for<rt>firmly demand for</rt>
        </ruby> technological safeguards as well as legislative ones. For example, those designing technology to use for public health tracking can introduce artificial noise into data sets, such that aggregate patterns are still discernible but the identity of individuals cannot easily be inferred from <ruby>

        </ruby> data. Wherever this so-called differential privacy approach is possible, it should be considered. Likewise, personalized data can often be made available case by case, only when needed, rather than by providing the government with permanent backdoor access to data sets. <u><sup class="pattern">SP12</sup>Italy and Germany have taken this approach, allowing cellphone providers to make location data available only for specific regions and narrow time frames.</u> Those designing the systems to meet today’s crisis must guard <ruby>

        German Chancellor Angela Merkel argued in a recent televised address that the severity of the current restrictions demands that the government make its decisions with particular transparency. In the United States, state and federal agencies should address this need by immediately identifying and empowering agencies that can oversee the practice of infectious disease management. These regulatory agencies will be <ruby>
            charged with<rt>given the responsibility of</rt>
        </ruby> making sure that health authorities remain within legal bounds, respond to citizens’ complaints, and communicate clearly to the public.
    </p>
    <p>
        To lament the “death of privacy,” and to dance on its grave, has become fashionable, as if the expansion of state surveillance and the commodification of personal data have rendered involuntary disclosure an inevitable fact of modern life. But this view is misguided, as recent laws such as the European General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act demonstrate. Those laws resulted from years of coalition building and advocacy, dedicated to rearticulating the meaning of privacy in the twenty-first century and rebalancing the scales after a period of passivity. Such coalitions are vital again today.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and in the months and years to come, U.S. citizens must again define privacy—and <ruby>
            spell out<rt>explian in detail</rt>
        </ruby> its justified exceptions—but this time, in relation to biomedical and geo-located data. Americans have a duty to guard liberty, in the words of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, even “when the government’s purposes are beneficent.” Doing so requires neither the surrender of privacy nor the rejection of medical science. ◆
