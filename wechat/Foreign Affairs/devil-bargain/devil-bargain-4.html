        If Americans are indeed entering a brave new world of biosurveillance, better to step into it with clear <ruby>
            conviction <rt>strong beleif</rt>
        </ruby> than to stumble unwittingly over the threshold. For this reason, discussing privacy, even in the middle of the pandemic, is important. <ruby>
            But as worrisome as <rt>=As worrisome; Although worrisome</rt>
        </ruby> all of the above trends might seem, none suggests the need to <ruby>
            pit privacy against <rt>make privacy compete with</rt>
        </ruby> public health, as if the pursuit of one should render the other infeasible. Both ends are immensely valuable, and to preserve them requires <ruby>
            nothing more or less than <rt>only and exactly the</rt>
        </ruby> long-term vigilance against the erosion of the rule of law.
    </p>
   
    <p>
        As the United States and other countries develop new means of tracking and controlling the spread of disease, the key concern should be for <ruby>
            the bureaucratic half-life <rt>（行政措施的）有效期限</rt>
        </ruby> of the emergency measures. Will these new technological capabilities and legal frameworks outlive the extraordinary circumstances that produced them? Without <ruby>
            sunset clauses <rt>解除合約/限制等的條款</rt>
        </ruby>, such interventions can readily evolve into a new normal—in which state-sponsored biomedical monitoring becomes routine at the national or even global level.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some legislatures have already foreseen this problem and limited the emergency measures accordingly. In the United Kingdom, the government must review its COVID-19 policies at least every 21 days. In the state of New York, a review must occur after 30 days. Similar provisions can also cover the repurposing of existing surveillance capabilities and ensure that they are used transparently and appropriately—especially since they are now applied to a very different context from the one for which they were designed. The United States developed many of its surveillance technologies and databases in the context of the “global war on terror.” These systems gather information about foreigners and are often required to screen out citizens, a <ruby>
            distinction <rt>contrast feature</rt>
        </ruby> that is far less relevant in fighting a disease that knows no border or citizenship status.
    </p>

    <p>
        There remains a danger that the technology and logic of biosurveillance will over time be applied in contexts where they are inappropriate, unconstitutional, unnecessary, or counterproductive. Consider the militarization of police departments in the United States after 2001: technologies that were intended to increase the responsiveness of law enforcement to terror attacks migrated downstream into the routine operations of everyday policing. Similarly, aggressively monitoring people’s health data might have short-term value during a pandemic but could become inappropriate and problematic if it simply became habitual under normal conditions. Biomedical data must be protected by a regulatory framework that safeguards against leaks, minimizes the potential for abuse, and imposes limits on its commodification.

        To articulate the value of privacy, and to spell out the specific exceptions that can be justified on the grounds of public health, is in fact no novel task. Since its emergence in the late nineteenth century, the right to privacy has been defined only in part by what it encompasses and <ruby>
            equally <rt>also</rt>
        </ruby> by what it excludes. <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>Exceptions are 
            a remarkably <ruby>unexceptional feature<rt>a feature that is worth attention</rt>
        </ruby> of <ruby>
            privacy jurisprudence<rt>the study of laws on privacy</rt>
        </ruby> and privacy discourse in the United States.</u> But they must still be specified, in order to give form and substance to an often vague idea.

            In the United States, the study and discussion of laws on privacy has a feature that is worth attention: there are exceptions (where the laws are not appropriate).
