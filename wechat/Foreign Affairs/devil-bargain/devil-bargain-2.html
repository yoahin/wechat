    But privacy and public health do not have to be incommensurable goals. Assertive containment strategies do not require Americans to treat privacy as the unfortunate <ruby>holdover of<rt>old thing from</rt></ruby> a pre-pandemic age, nor does a defense of privacy require <ruby>epidemiological disarmament<rt>不采取防疫措施或防護</rt></ruby>. The big threats to personal privacy will come not primarily from the measures taken over the next one to five weeks but from the institutionalization of biosurveillance technologies over the coming one to five years. Those are the <ruby>repercussions<rt>consequences</rt></ruby> to plan for.
