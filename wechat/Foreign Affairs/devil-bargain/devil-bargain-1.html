<b>Shelter in place</b> (also known as a shelter-in-place warning, SAME code SPW) is to seek safety within the building one already occupies, rather than to evacuate the area or seek a community emergency shelter.

The choice appears to be binary: either we heed the advice of medical experts about the benefits of aggressive contact tracing, which has worked well in countries such as Taiwan and South Korea, and agree to an <ruby>erosion<rt>gradual destruction</rt></rt></ruby> of the right to privacy—or <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>we <ruby>double down on<rt>become more serious about</rt></ruby> a defense of privacy, knowing full well that doing so is likely to undermine public health.</u>
